(2:17)

No matter what the Atlanta Falcons’ plan is for Round 1 of Thursday’s 2020 NFL draft, they can’t afford to miss on their first pick.

Everyone knows the stakes for the Falcons coming off back-to-back 7-9 seasons. Owner Arthur Blank expects the playoffs and nothing less. He retained coach Dan Quinn and general manager Thomas Dimitroff with a postseason push in mind.

The Falcons aren’t just one player away from being a Super Bowl contender, but they certainly need their top draft pick to make an immediate impact. He can't be a developmental project, an extreme character risk or injury prone. It's already going to be challenging enough to get a rookie up to speed based on how the coronavirus pandemic has altered the offseason workout schedule.

There have been plenty of rumblings about the Falcons possibly trading up from the 16th overall pick into the top 5, perhaps to secure either a top cornerback such as Ohio State’s Jeff Okudah or a defensive tackle such as Auburn’s Derrick Brown.

Dimitroff, who called the current group of NFL general managers a “very active” trading group, hasn’t tipped his hand -- at least not publicly -- about which player the Falcons covet most. Dimitroff has orchestrated 17 draft trades with the Falcons, five in the first round, since taking over in 2008. His most memorable was trading five picks -- two first-rounders, two fourth-rounders and a second-rounder -- to move from 27th overall to No. 6 in order to select superstar receiver Julio Jones in 2011.

With Washington in rebuilding mode and listening to offers for the No. 2 overall pick, there's a school of thought that the desperate Falcons should risk it all and surrender their higher picks this season and a future first-rounder for a ""can’t-miss"" prospect such as Ohio State pass-rusher Chase Young. The Falcons currently have their first-round pick, a second-rounder (47th), a third-rounder (78th), two fourth-rounders (119th and 143rd) and a seventh-rounder (228th). The last time a team made a comparable jump into the top 5 was 2016, when the Rams moved up from No. 15 to No. 1 to take quarterback Jared Goff. But the price was steep: The Rams traded the Tennessee Titans two first-rounders, two second-rounders, and two third-rounders over two years. (The Rams also received the Titans' 2016 fourth- and sixth-round picks.)

If the Falcons are not willing to make the bold move for Young, is it really worth trading into the top 5?

“Chase Young is the only special guy,"" one NFC executive said, referring to the defensive prospects in this draft. “Okudah is really good, but corners aren’t that valuable. If you’re really good up front, your corners don’t have to be that good.

“Isaiah Simmons is a freak, but he doesn’t have a natural position. Is he a safety? Is he a linebacker? I wouldn’t want to pick a guy in the top 5 if I wasn’t 100 percent sure what role he is gonna play.""

Most assume the Falcons will target a defender, although Quinn made sure to mention how impressed he is with the offensive tackles and defensive tackles in this draft. Cornerback is a primary need because the Falcons released former Pro Bowler Desmond Trufant and are relying on youngsters Isaiah Oliver and Kendall Sheffield moving forward. Although Quinn said Sheffield has the makings of a No. 1 cornerback, he certainly wasn’t going to tout the speedy former fourth-round pick as anything less. Regardless of where Sheffield plays, the Falcons need to add a starting-caliber cornerback considering all the nickel played these days and the amount of offensive talent in the NFC South.

ESPN analyst Matt Bowen said the cornerback class goes seven deep in terms of players capable of starting immediately. While he ranks Okudah as the best of the bunch, Bowen said CJ Henderson would be a hit with the Falcons. Dimitroff called Henderson a “confident cover guy"" who will get a lot of draft-day attention. Some of the other cornerbacks are Clemson’s A.J. Terrell, Alabama’s Trevon Diggs, TCU’s Jeff Gladney, LSU's Kristian Fulton, Ohio State's Damon Arnette and Utah’s Jaylon Johnson, who is coming off right shoulder surgery.

The question for the Falcons might be whether to stay put at No. 16, where they still can get a solid starter at cornerback or defensive tackle, or make that move up and lose their second-round pick (47th overall) and perhaps a starting-caliber prospect for 2020 they could couple with the 16th pick.

Some have linked the Falcons to LSU pass-rusher K’Lavon Chaisson at No. 16. That might not be a bad pick, but several executives have compared him to former Falcons pass-rusher Vic Beasley Jr., the eighth overall pick in 2015 who ended up being more of a one-year wonder before the Falcons let him walk to Tennessee this offseason. Quinn sounded more inclined to target an interior lineman with pass-rush ability than another edge rusher after signing Dante Fowler Jr. in free agency. South Carolina’s Javon Kinlaw might be that guy after Brown, who is a likely top-5 pick.

“The one up the middle is the hardest to find,"" Quinn said. “So I would say you always kind of would think that space first -- guys who have pass-rush ability in tight quarters. That’s a hard thing to do inside. Just for me, not just for our own team where we’re at, but overall, I think those are the hardest guys to find.""

The Falcons need to find somebody ready to help them make a postseason run this season."

Doctor and Former Astronaut Talks Coronavirus in Houston,"Dr. William Fisher, a former astronaut and father of Fox News Correspondent Kristin Fisher, explains what it's like in the hospitals, what we learned from the 1918 Spanish flu, and why he's more afraid to go into work now than he was to go into space.",www.houstoniamag.com,"A few weeks ago, we spoke to an Italian doctor about what it was like on the European frontlines of the Coronavirus pandemic. Now, as Houston continues to trudge through the crisis, we wanted to know how doctors are facing off with the virus here. So, we spoke with Dr. William Fisher, a local E.R. doctor and a former NASA astronaut about what it’s like on the inside.

Fisher has been living and practicing medicine in Houston since the late 1970s. He joined NASA in 1980, and spent 170 hours in space—including two space walks—aboard the Space Shuttle Discovery, which launched in late summer 1985. In 1991, he left NASA and continued to practice emergency medicine. Now 74, Fisher practices at clinics in League City and Pasadena as well as in Memorial Hermann-Texas Medical Center's emergency room here in Houston.

Fisher's story went viral when his daughter Kristin Fisher, a Fox News correspondent covering the crisis in D.C., shared an Instagram post about his work in the E.R. back in March and then Fox interviewed him live on air. Kristin Fisher describes her father as a larger-than-life figure with a wild-man personality who's been preparing for a pandemic for decades. ""He's been predicting this, and preparing for this for as long as I can remember,"" she says. Her father has had canned food stockpiled in a sort-of panic room in his house for years, and he even encouraged her to write about a looming pandemic for a sixth-grade paper, which is exactly why she thinks he should be out on the front lines.

""He's doing exactly what he was meant to do in this moment,"" Kristin Fisher says.

What is it like working in a hospital right now?

I would say it’s like an ordered chaos, and on the East Coast, it’s like a nightmare.

Are you nervous that the situation on the East Coast could make its way to Houston?

I think the fact that we’re not as densely populated and the fact that none of us want to catch this, and we’re being as careful as we can—I’m hoping that we don’t get it anywhere near as bad as New York has gotten it, or New Orleans, or Detroit, for example.

Have there been any changes in protocols at the hospitals because of this?

I’m wearing a white Tyvek bunny suit all the time. I wear a mask, I wear head-dressing, and I wear a plastic face shield, along with gloves, of course, the whole time I’m there. And it’s not comfortable; I mean, the mask is hot and scratchy, the suit’s hot, too, but we’re all being as careful as we can. I’ve never been so careful about something in my life, and I think I can speak for my colleagues.

What does someone who comes into the E.R. with COVID-19-like symptoms actually look like?

Here’s the weird thing about this: The typical symptoms—the most common are cough, fever, shortness of breath, and then things like muscle aches—so many other illnesses present the same way. The insidious thing about this is we think a large number of people are totally asymptomatic, but are still contagious.

How is COVID-19 different than the flu?

They said that that this thing was three times more contagious than the flu, and the flu is really contagious. It’s terrible. But we have a treatment for the flu, and we have a vaccine for the flu. We have neither for this thing for sure.

As of March 31, there were eight different strains of this virus. It started out with one from Wuhan, and then there was a second strain, and now there’re eight. And they’re all about equally dangerous. But there’s nothing to say that the ninth, 10th, or 11th strain won’t be much more lethal, so you have to keep watching that.

Have you ever seen anything like this before?

Yeah, on television. Movies like Contagion, The Stand, or Outbreak. Those all dealt with similar situations—maybe a little more severe—but pandemics do come about once a century.

You’re well versed in the world’s history with pandemics. What can we learn from how the general public approached the 1918 Spanish flu?

You know, more people died of the Spanish flu in 1918 than all the deaths in World War I. It’s astounding how many people died from it. Air travel wasn’t nearly as extensive, so it would stay in one place and ravage it. But [the flu] managed to work its way around the world.

But we learned about social distancing then. In Philadelphia, they were advised to socially distance—this was 102 years ago—but they decided to go ahead and have this parade that had 200,000 people along the sides. Philadelphia later was devastated by the flu. The counterpoint to that is the city of Saint Louis rigorously practiced social distancing, and they had very little Spanish flu. The techniques that worked before work now.

Different states are projected to hit their peaks at different times. Is it safe for different parts of the country to go back to work when other places haven’t peaked?

It’s not safe, but neither is destroying the economy of our country. So, you have to weigh it: What is our nation worth? Do we wait until it’s perfectly safe, and then we’re bankrupt or in another depression? Or do we say, “We’re going to go back now. It’s not going to be perfectly safe for everybody, but we’re through the big hump""? We have to balance off our national interests against the safety of going back too soon.

You talked to your daughter Kristin live on air that you were more afraid to go into work now than you were to go into space. What did you mean by that?

When we started at NASA, before the first space shuttle flew, we were told we were expected to lose one out of every 25th flight. We were told it was a 4 percent mortality. Turns out, we only lost two, so it turns out to be maybe 1.9 percent of our shuttles were lost. So, we knew what we were facing, and we also knew the engineering that was involved. There was a lot of money spent on a lot of safety features—although nothing’s perfectly safe. But to tell you the truth, we were so well trained at NASA, and I had been through simulations so much, it wasn’t nervous lifting off, it was just “Neat” or “I’m glad I got to go.”

But there’s so much unknown about this virus, and currently the mortality is 6 percent—so that’s three times what NASA was—and it’s an invisible enemy. If you’re right in front of me, I can find you. If you’re a technical problem on the shuttle, we can fix it. But here’s the thing: it’s in the air, it’s on surfaces. So yeah, I’m an older guy, I’m 74 years old, this is a higher mortality rate, and I’m being as careful as I humanly can.

How has your experience at NASA and your 45-year career as a doctor prepared you for the current crisis?

Everything you do now [as a doctor] is a culmination of the people you’ve taken care of before, and they’re all with you. It’s kind of like at NASA. We used to say, “We are on the shoulders of giants.” Centuries of scientists and creative people have put together the knowledge and the mathematics and the physics to let us to do this. But we aren’t doing it, humanity’s doing it. It’s analogous that I practice medicine on the shoulders of all my previous patients, and bring all of their problems and the experience I had with them to me when I am in the E.R. And most of the time you don’t need it. I mean, a sprained ankle is a sprained ankle. But, in this case you do. It’s rewarding to use what you’ve earned.

You’re older, you have underlying health conditions, but you’re still going into work. Why not pass the baton to the next generation of doctors?

This is the greatest public health crisis in our lifetimes. It’s the greatest one, and to just blow it off and say, “I want to sit at home because I’m scared”? No. I’m concerned, and it’s a healthy concern, but I don’t like the idea of running away from danger, especially when it’s a danger I’ve been trained to combat. So, it’s not bravery so much as, ""I can’t not do it,"" if you’ll pardon the double negative. I may live to regret these words, but right now I feel fine.

Do you have any advice for Houstonians?

The main thing is, don’t go to the E.R. if you get sick, and don’t go to the hospital unless you’re really sick. If you have a sore throat, and you go to the E.R., that maybe where you pick up the coronavirus. Even if you have the coronavirus, unless you’re having trouble breathing, or you pass out, or you have something worse than just flu-like symptoms, you’re not doing anybody any favors by going anywhere.

Senator Panfilo Lacson posed this question on Thursday after President Rodrigo Duterte offered P10 million to any Filipino who can discover a vaccine for the coronavirus disease (COVID-19).

“While the President has made a P10-million offer to whoever can develop a vaccine for COVID-19, it would mean much more if the government invested more on research and development than the token annual average share of 0.4% from the General Appropriations Act,” Lacson said in a statement.

“How about investing more on R&D (research and development) than a token annual average share of 0.4% from the GAA (General Appropriations Act)?” he added.

The senator has repeatedly raised the issue of the “minuscule” budget allocation for the country’s research and development which he earlier pointed out as having accounted for only 0.39 percent of the P4.1 trillion 2020 budget.

“We only need to look at how much the most prosperous countries spend on R&D to see why we are among the laggards,” Lacson went on.

“Even if we bump up the percentage to 1 or 2 percent of the national budget, it would make a major difference,” he added.

Duterte earlier said the Philippines will participate in studying a possible cure for the virus as he called for cooperation among countries in developing a vaccine.

The Philippine General Hospital (PGH) has also asked those who have recovered from COVID-19 to make convalescent plasma donations.

A vaccine to treat COVID-19 has yet to be approved but some medical professionals believe antibodies harvested in the convalescent plasma from the blood of COVID-19 survivors can help other patients recover.

Convalescent plasma therapy, while still a new study for COVID-19, has been used against infectious diseases like the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, H1N1, measles and to some extent, Ebola.

To date, Philippine health officials have confirmed that 6,710 individuals in the Philippines have contracted COVID-19. Of this number, 693 have recovered while 446 patients have died.

Globally, the coronavirus pandemic has affected over 2,557,500 people and killed 177,660 even as 690, 600 have managed to recover. COVID-19 is caused by a new coronavirus identified as SARS-CoV-2.

The reasoning: “Wisconsin’s Zack Baun is a do-it-all linebacker with pass-rushing skills and experience as well as the body type and athleticism to play as a stack linebacker against the run or in coverage. Pairing with the already athletic Packers defensive front, Baun will bring all kinds of heat from the middle of the field.”

Our breakdown: Baun is both intriguing and terrifying as a potential first-round pick for the Packers. He’s a slippery, active edge rusher with experience dropping into coverage and playing in space, presenting an opportunity to transition into a hybrid off-ball/edge rusher position at the next level. The Packers need an off-ball linebacker, and teams are always looking for disruptive rushers. It’s possible Baun could play a Clay Matthews-like role, serving as an off-ball linebacker on early downs before transitioning into more of an attacking role on passing downs. It’s an appealing projection for a really good football player. But it’s also a scary one. Baun doesn’t have elite size or athleticism, and he’d be transitioning to a brand new and physically demanding position. Also, as an off-ball linebacker, he’d be doing far less of what he’s best at – rushing the quarterback. Baun is a smart, tough player who could provide value at two important spots in the defensive front, but he comes with extra risk. The Packers would need a solid plan and complete trust in his versatility to make him the pick at No. 30."

Below are a just a few stories of import and interest from the last few weeks, many of which are covered in more detail on the BitBlog. For additional coverage of the COVID-19 epidemic, the offers wealth of for guidance on issues such as health care, labor and employment, real estate and emergency financial support.

In what may be the most important FinTech legal ruling of the last few weeks or potentially this year, Judge P. Kevin Castel of the Southern District of New York struck his gavel and “hung up” on Telegram’s contentious $1.7 billion initial coin offering (“ICO”). Judge Castel ruled Telegram's planned distribution of Grams, a digital asset to be used on the TON Blockchain, likely constitutes a securities offering under the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act”) and should not be afforded an exemption from registration. Castel granted the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) a preliminary injunction preventing Telegram’s distribution of its Gram tokens for the foreseeable future. Notably, Judge Castel found that “the economic reality is that the Gram Purchase Agreements and the anticipated distribution of Grams by the Initial Purchasers to the public via the TON Blockchain are part of a single scheme.”

Telegram argued that the ICO took place through two separate transactions; (1) the initial sale of a security exempt from registration with the SEC under the Securities Act pursuant to the safe harbor of Regulation D using a structure called a Simple Agreement for Future Tokens (“SAFT”); and (2) a planned distribution of the digital asset to be called Grams to the initial SAFT purchasers in the ICO. Telegram argued only the first of these transactions should be subject to securities laws because the later distribution of Grams did not constitute securities. Instead, Judge Castel preliminarily found that there is a reasonable likelihood that the two transactions will be treated as one under the securities law doctrine known as integration. Because this is a preliminary finding, it has no precedential effect in or out of the case, but it does demonstrate the heavy odds that Telegram will have to overcome to win.

Judge Castel also rejected Telegram’s request to exclusively issue Grams outside of the United States. The court did not believe that Telegram could “implement safeguards” to prevent U.S persons from obtaining the Gram digital assets. Punctuating his decision, Judge Castel noted that since “the TON Blockchain was designed and is intended to grant anonymity to those who purchase or sell Grams […] any restriction as to whom a foreign Initial Purchaser could resell Grams would be of doubtful real-world enforceability.”

Like Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid gloriously diving off a cliff, Telegram appears to have taken the fall and may be taking the infamous SAFT with it. However, Telegram and supporters are making a number of important arguments about the regulation of digital assets. The Blockchain Association recently filed an amicus brief [1] in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit Court in Telegram’s appeal of the order granting injunction, arguing that the SEC’s limited regulatory guidance and public statements encouraged the adoption of the SAFT. While Polsinelli has actively discouraged the use of the SAFT since its rise to prominence, the editors of the BitBlog were happy to see the Blockchain Association echo concerns originally raised by Polsinelli FinTech and Regulation attorneys several years ago, that the SEC has failed to engage in formal rulemaking to address the regulation of digital assets.[2]

All About the Integration - SEC Says Kik Illegally Offered Securities

If proponents of the SAFT are not having a hard enough time with the Telegraph injunction, they should read the SEC's brief in support of motion for summary judgment in the . The SEC argues that even if Kik conducted two separate offerings of Kin, Kik still does not qualify for the Rule 506(c) exemption from registration of the securities because it cannot demonstrate that its “two” offerings should not be integrated and considered a single offering.

The Best Laid Plans: SEC Announces Examination Priorities for Regulation Best Interest and Form CRS

On June 5, 2019, the SEC adopted Regulation Best Interest (“Regulation Best Interest”), which establishes a new standard of conduct under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) for broker-dealers and related individuals when making a recommendation for any securities transaction or securities investment strategy to a retail customer.[3] In conjunction with the adoption of Regulation Best Interest, the SEC will require SEC registered broker-dealers and investment advisers to provide a brief customer or client relationship summary that provides information about the firm.[4]

On April 7, 2019, the SEC Office of Compliance Inspection and Examinations (“OCIE”) announced its areas of focus in 2020 for examining compliance by broker-dealers with Regulation Best Interest and Form CRS and by investment advisers with Form CRS.[5] Polsinelli’s FinTech and Regulation Practice and Investment Funds Team have prepared a of the OCIE Risk alert.

New Crypto Lawsuits…Just Desserts For ICOs or Legal Obstacles to Claims?

On April 3, 2020, eleven lawsuits were filed in the Southern District of New York against a broad array of issuers and exchanges for allegedly offering and selling unregistered securities in violation of both federal and state securities laws during the ICO boom of 2017 and 2018.

These lawsuits seek billions of dollars in damages against a number of well-known crypto-companies. The lawsuits accuse these issuers and exchanges of selling digital assets without (i) registering with federal or state regulators or (ii) an applicable registration exemption. The cases also contend that crypto-trading platforms benefited financially from listing these illegally offered securities. The investors also allege that, in addition to selling unregistered securities, crypto-trading platforms manipulated the cryptocurrency markets for their own benefit.

While the suits are in their infancy, and the defendants have not yet raised any defenses, some argue these suits were filed outside of the applicable statute of limitations period. Ordinarily, the statute of limitations for clams under the Securities Act is one year from discovery of the violation, but no more than three years after the offering for claims. However, because the structure of many offerings included a long delay from the time that the alleged securities were offered until the digital assets were issued, plaintiffs are likely to argue that the three year limitations period should begin with the issuance of the digital assets rather than the offer date. Further, while state law claims were not alleged, many of states have statutes of limitation periods that exceed the Securities Act.

Hell Hath No Fury Like an ICO Investor Scorned

Richard B. Levin, Chair of the FinTech and Regulation Practice was recently quoted in Decryprt about the recent filings of class action lawsuits. In the article Polsinelli and Levin were recognized for having predicted two years ago that a flurry of crypto class actions would be coming. In the article, , when asked about clams of some lawyers that the cases will be dismissed, Levin noted he does not agree and that the lawsuits could drag on for years and drain some of these companies of most of the money they raised in their token offerings.

On March 4, 2020, published a proposed rule change “Facilitating Capital Formation and Expanding Investment Opportunities by Improving Access to Capital in Private Markets” (the “Release”),[6] the SEC proposed amendments to several SEC rules providing exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (“Securities Act”). The Proposals are intended to increase the utilization of infrequently relied upon private offering exemptions under the Securities Act and to harmonize various private offering exemptions and related SEC rules. Countless companies and investment funds, from blockchain focused early state companies to mature and well established companies, raise capital in reliance on one or more of the exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act.

The Proposals are intended to meet evolving market needs by increasing the efficiency of the capital raising process by raising the ceiling on the amount of funds that could be raised in three infrequently used exemptions under the Securities Act: Regulation A, Regulation CF and Rule 504 of Regulation D. The Proposals also seek to afford greater clarity around the SEC’s integration doctrine that can pose challenges for companies with ongoing or recurring financing needs. Finally, the Proposals would harmonize certain rules common to many types of exempt offerings, with the intent to potentially make it easier for companies to avoid compliance pitfalls in their private capital raising initiatives. Certain of the amendments proposed in the Release are outlined in an written by members of Polsinelli’s Securities and Corporate Finance practice team.

The the digital currency structure would be revised to address concerns raised by lawmakers and regulators in a number of jurisdictions. This is no surprise considering the regulatory headwind that Facebook has met from global regulators and lawmakers. The new proposal includes a stable coin fixed to a single currency instead of the original one that was set to a basket of currencies. Another important change, though one that was becoming increasing obvious was the project is now planning to launch in phases and in consultation with regulators.

In the spirit of cooperation with issuers, the FSB has published for consultation ten high-level recommendations to address the regulation of global stablecoins. The FSB noted stablecoins “have the potential to enhance the efficiency of the provision of financial services, but may also generate risks to financial stability.” The FSB’s recommendations call for regulation, supervision and oversight that takes into account the evolution of global stablecoins.

The consultation paper represents an important opportunity for FinTech firms, regulators, government officials, and academics to comment on the proper regulation of stanlecoins. The public consultation period closes on Wednesday July 15, 2020. The final recommendations will be published in October 2020.

CFTC Chair on the line with the Chamber of Digital Commerce

CFTC Chair Heath Tarbert joined the through a webinar on Wednesday, April 7, 2020 to discuss the impact of COVID-19 on virtual currency activity in the current market. Among comments addressing general unrest in the state of the economy in connection with the current epidemic, Chair Tarbert mentioned that the CFTC is in full support of the cryptocurrency industry and stated that this time of crisis might present an opportunity for blockchain and digital assets to capitalize on situations where the majority of people are effectively homebound.

Though it may not be apparent yet, the past six weeks have been transformative for both the world at large and the regulation of digital asset. The decisions of courts and regulators further clarify, and perhaps limit, the terrain on which digital assets may be issued and traded. But things are changing rapidly and a digital currency or security that is not tied to the economic health of a nation could quickly find home in a necessary niche. Some key takeaways are that Fin-tech obviously does not in a vacuum and the essential qualities of block-chain and distributed ledger technology are uniquely suited to this time.

Court Tells Asylum Seeker His Fear of Retaliation by Ukraine Does Not Justify Concealing Funds through Cryptocurrency

Volodymyr Kvashuk, a Ukrainian citizen seeking asylum in the United States, was convicted for defrauding Microsoft of more than $10 million. Mr. Kvashuk used a program to steal gift cards from Microsoft, his then employer, and converted the funds to cryptocurrency. On appeal, Mr. Kvashuk argued the court’s exclusion of his asylum application undermined his conviction—that he had used cryptocurrency to conceal funds not as a means for fraud, but instead to avoid detection by Ukrainian authorities, who he feared would retaliate if his asylum application were discovered. But the court was unconvinced, for one, by the lack of evidence supporting Mr. Kvashuk’s assertion that his actions were motivated by fear of foreign persecution. The court upheld the conviction but opened the door for future asylum seekers to justify questionable use of cryptocurrency. For the full BitBlog post, .

However, opportunities exist to tap them as agents of change.",theconversation.com,"Indonesia is known worldwide for its remarkable marine life. It lies at the heart of the Coral Triangle – an area that hosts 76% of the world’s coral species – and its marine sector accounts for over 6.5% of the country’s GDP.

At the south-western end of Sulawesi Island lies the Spermonde Archipelago. It is a rich and biodiverse region for coral reefs and fishery resources.

However, a recent academic report found a strong decrease in the amount of coral in Spermonde in the last few years, partly due to dynamite and cyanide fishing.

Such destructive fishing practices are widespread around South-East Asia and are a direct cause of death for corals and fish.

Our study conducted in 2014 in Spermonde indicates that “patron-client” systems, or what locals call “punggawa-sawi”, in the region’s commercial fisheries could foster these unsustainable practices.

This patronage system – common across South-East Asia – is essentially an informal credit system that bonds wealthy and well-connected individuals with many fishers through a reciprocal arrangement.

In exchange for favours such as loans for fishing equipment and protection, patrons receive benefits in the form of labour and exclusive catches.

However, this arrangement often ends up pushing their fishers to use techniques such as cyanide fishing to catch live fish – which are more valuable but harder to catch. This essentially endangers the coral reef ecosystems around them.

In Spermonde, we found 53% of local fishermen were in a patron-client relationship, while only 37% were independent.

Fishers indebted to their patrons have to repay their loans slowly by selling their fishing catch exclusively to their patron, who sets the price and keeps track of the debt balance.

These fishermen are also expected to specialise in catching fish that their patron specialises in selling.

This situation places patrons in a unique position to affect the way fishing takes place – what species to target and which fishing methods to use.

From 2014 to 2015, we interviewed both independent fishermen and fishers in a patron-client relation in Spermonde. We also measured what they had caught and compared the catches of both types of fishermen.

Our study revealed that fishermen with patrons caught more valuable seafood – especially live fish. Independent fishermen landed more non-commercial items that they target to feed their families.

Specifically, 32% of the catch was live fish for fishermen with patrons, while only 19% for independent fishermen.

Valuable seafood is often caught by using potassium cyanide to stun the fish and catch it alive. These fish include species that are higher up in the food chain and typically take longer to replenish, such as groupers, Napoleon wrasse or Spanish mackerel.

Unfortunately, cyanide fishing can also indiscriminately kill a number of other species in the surrounding area and, more importantly, it kills the corals which are the foundation of the reef ecosystem.

While cyanide fishing is illegal in Indonesia, some studies indicate the existence of a network through which patrons usually bribe authorities and protect their fishermen from being prosecuted.

This confirms the extraordinary role of the patron-client system as an informal but dominant alternative governance system in the area.

Tapping into the patronage system for sustainability

Fisheries patronage has its critics and defenders.

Some studies point out patrons’ significant role in normalising illegal, destructive fishing practices and in trapping fishermen in perpetual debts.

On the other hand, a 2012 study explains how the patronage arrangement acts as an important social security system for local fishermen.

Besides ensuring fishers always have buyers for their catch, patrons provide fishermen and their families with financial resources to cope with bad fishing seasons or personal emergencies.

This means that patron-client systems – however destructive they currently are – do reduce fishermen’s socioeconomic vulnerability and remain a fundamental part of the social fabric of Spermonde’s small-scale fisheries.

In cases like Indonesia where enforcement capacity is limited and alternatives to fishing scarce, the government could recognise the patron-client system as a potential ally in the fight against unsustainable fishing practices.

Effective cessation of destructive fishing can produce remarkable recovery of fish populations.

For instance, some small-scale fisheries have shifted towards fishery certification programs as a result of the increasing market demand for sustainable products, which is likely the future path for fisheries.

We suggest patrons could ride this wave and become key actors, through their ability to reach a large number of small-scale fishers, to harness positive environmental attitudes and endorse sustainable fishing practices.

Of course, such a shift will not happen if the situation continues to favour illegal fishing.

To increase the cost for patrons to engage in illegal fishing, effective enforcement is crucial. This could be achieved by increasing the resources available to the competent authorities, such as the country’s Task Force 115, which is responsible for tackling illegal fishing.

Then, to make a shift towards sustainable fishing practices more attractive, the government could streamline the process for patrons to enter fishery certification programs and reward them with financial benefits, such as lower export taxes.

Offering environmental education and programs to build meaningful connections between local people and their coral reefs has also been proven to encourage people to abandon destructive fishing practices."

Meanwhile, he also announced the slight loosening of MCO restrictions to allow university students who are still restricted to their campuses as well as those who are stuck in their hometowns for the duration of the MCO to travel.",www.theedgemarkets.com,"KUALA LUMPUR (April 23): Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin has announced the third extension to the Movement Control Order (MCO), which will be effective from April 28 to May 12 under its fourth phase.

The government will also slightly loosen MCO restrictions to allow university students who are still restricted to their campuses, as well as those stuck in their hometowns during the duration of the MCO to travel.

During a televised national address earlier, the prime minister said the decision was made after going through the data provided by the Ministry of Health (MoH). He did not rule out the possibility that the MCO could be further extended after May 12.

“While there have been positive development in terms of the COVID-19 numbers, the steps that we are currently taking to curb the spread of the COVID-19 virus will continue to be enforced until we are confident that the outbreak is contained successfully.

“Therefore, I would like to announce that the MCO, which was previously expected to end on April 28, will be extended for another two weeks until May 12,” he said.

During Phase 4 of the MCO, the government will monitor the developments before making any further decision, said Muhyiddin.

He noted that many have made the journey back to their hometowns before the partial lockdown came into force on March 18; hence, they have not been able to return to their homes in the cities.

The government is currently considering allowing those that fall under these categories a one-time pass permitting them to return to their families and homes, although they will have to apply for the permission with the Royal Malaysian Police.

The applications can be made either online or at the nearest police station, by appointment.

The movement of those that are permitted to travel will be controlled by the police to reduce the incidence of congestion on the highways, as well as at the rest stops along the way.

The details relating to this measure will be announced soon, he said.

City Hall’s latest pivot to focus on the city’s nursing homes during the pandemic comes less than a week after it was revealed that at least 44 people had died of the virus at Carmel Richmond Healthcare and Rehabilitation Center in Dongan Hills.

City Hall said it has sent 210 clinical staff volunteers to 40 nursing homes citywide to date and plans to double the number of staff to 420.

So far, City Hall said it has sent additional staff to the six Island nursing homes including Carmel Richmond Healthcare, Eger Health Care & Rehab, Island Rehabilitative Services, Silverlake Specialized Care Center, St. Mary’s Center Inc., and Verrazano Nursing Home.

Moving forward, the city will get information from a state portal to know where it should send additional surge staff the city’s nursing homes accordingly, City Hall said.

The city has also sent nearly ten million pieces of personal protective equipment to all 169 nursing homes in the city including 40,000 N95 masks, 800,00 surgical face masks 40,000 face shields, 1.5 million gloves and at least 105,000 gowns or coveralls just last week, and plan to increase its weekly shipment by 50%.

City Hall could not provide a breakdown at press time of the number of supplies it has sent to the Island nursing homes.

Staten Island is home to 10 nursing homes. Some of those nursing homes are run by the city’s Health and Hospitals network, the state, Archdiocese and privately owned. But all nursing homes are regulated by the state.

The Carmel Richmond Healthcare and Rehabilitation Center had been in a tie for the third-highest coronavirus death total at nursing homes across the state, according to state data compiled last week. Cobble Hill Health Center in Brooklyn had the most with 55.

However, Borough President James Oddo, who has called for more action to protect nursing homes across the borough, said in an interview with the Advance, he’s worried the list could paint an inaccurate portrait of how the virus is affecting the state’s most vulnerable.

Oddo said that the city’s latest commitment to help the Island’s nursing homes was “about damn time.”

""The disaster within the disaster has been our skilled nursing facilities. To date, we in government have failed them. The Mayor’s announcement and what we expect to hear from Governor Cuomo later today give these struggling facilities a fighting chance to help our most vulnerable population. Simply put, it’s about damn time,” Oddo said.

In March, Gov. Andrew Cuomo mandated that nursing home residents who are taken to a hospital and test positive for the virus must be allowed to return to the facility to self-quarantine.

Last week he ordered that nursing homes and adult care facilities must notify next of kin within 24 hours if a family member tests positive for COVID-19 or dies due to the virus.

City Hall said it has also set up a task force to work with about half of all nursing homes to collect data on staffing, PPE, decedent management, and any other needs.

“Our city’s nursing homes are home to some of those most at risk for COVID-19,” said Mayor Bill de Blasio. “They need our support more than ever, which is why we are stepping in and sending more staff and support to assist those who protect and care for our most vulnerable.”

“This is a wasteful solution in search of a problem,” said Geoff Fettus, with the Natural Resources Defense Council environmental group. “We get much of our uranium from allies like Canada and Australia. There’s no national security reason to protect these polluters.”

One of the recommendations likely to spur the most protests is one to make it easier to mine for uranium, an essential mineral for nuclear power, on federal public lands, including streamlining environmental reviews.

Western tribes say past uranium mining has left a legacy of death and disease among their people. They and other opponents fear the administration will greenlight uranium mining in northern Arizona, outside the boundaries of Grand Canyon National Park, potentially contaminating water sources that they and millions of others rely on.

“Risking the health of tribal communities — especially during a global pandemic — and jeopardizing one of the wonders of the world does not make any sense,” Tracy Stone Manning with the National Wildlife Federation environmental advocacy group said in a statement.

The mining and nuclear-power industries have asked for a range of government action on their behalf. A nuclear industry trade association, the Nuclear Energy Institute, said the report didn’t go far enough to support the nuclear power industry — struggling in competition against cheaper natural gas, solar and wind. It said Thursday it would keep asking Congress for tax credits and other help.

Much of the uranium from U.S. mines is lower grade than some imported uranium, helping make U.S. production less attractive on the marketplace. In 2018, Canada was the main source of uranium bought in the U.S., at 24%, followed by Kazakhstan at 20%, Australia at 18%, and Russia at 13%. U.S. mines supplied only one-tenth of U.S. uranium bought.

“After decades of neglect, the entire U.S. commercial nuclear sector, from mining through power generation, is at high-risk of insolvency,” the administration task force said.

The task force supported research and promotion for the country’s civil nuclear technology. It called for capping imports of Russian uranium, accusing Russia of dumping uranium below cost, and recommended authorizing the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to block nuclear fuel fabricated in Russia or China for national security purposes.

Republican Sen. John Barrasso of the mining state of Wyoming, chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, said Thursday Russia had “weaponized” its nuclear fuel to undercut uranium miners in the U.S.

“The coronavirus pandemic has clearly demonstrated why America should not rely on other nations to supply critical materials. That includes uranium,” Barrasso said in a statement."

The man in his 50s is in isolation at home, county officials said Thursday. He is the county's 28th patient confirmed to have the virus.

No other details about his case were released.

The news of the man's infection comes just one day after the county's 27th patient was reported, a teenage girl who's also in isolation at home. Before that, the county went almost a week without recording a new case.

In other local coronavirus news Thursday, officials have closed Mount Shasta above 10,000 feet for at least the rest of April and likely beyond in a bid to deter out-of-area climbers as the virus continues to spread,.

The only people allowed past that threshold will be government workers on official business, according to Don Lee, visitor information services specialist for the U.S. Forest Service Mount Shasta Ranger District.

Lee said the mountain sees anywhere from 5,000 to 7,000 people flock to the area during a typical climbing season. The decision to bar those tourists comes amid continuing restrictions across California to protect against COVID-19.

“We’re trying to emphasize the governor’s stay-at-home order,” Lee said. “That’s priority No. 1.”

Another factor in the decision, Lee said, is unnecessary risk for emergency personnel, who might be exposed to the virus in a rescue situation.

The mountain won’t be completely off limits for those seeking the outdoors. Bunny Flat Trailhead (elevation of 6,950 feet), a popular parking area that sees up to 200 vehicles at times, remains open to the public.

The order states a violation is punishable by a fine under $5,000 for individuals, imprisonment for under six months, or both.

Shasta County teen tests positive; officials warn some restrictions could last a year or more

As of Thursday morning, another Shasta County resident has tested positive for the coronavirus, the first confirmed case since April 16.

A total of 27 county residents have now tested positive for the virus, the latest being a teenage girl in isolation at home, according to an announcement from the Shasta County Health and Human Services Agency on Wednesday evening.

Of the county's 27 cases, five are active, including one patient in the hospital. The other 22 cases include 19 patients who recovered and three who died.

More than a month into a California-wide stay-at-home order, some residents are asking when community restrictions might be lifted. Shasta County is currently operating under Phase 1 restrictions, the most severe, until Gov. Gavin Newsom allows counties to move into Phase 2, according to Dr. Karen Ramstrom, health officer for the county.

What would Phase 2 look like locally? That hasn't been decided, but Ramstrom said it would likely include some gatherings, starting with small numbers and gradually increasing. She said that phase would likely last a year to 18 months.

""(Phase 2 is) going to continue until we have a vaccine or medications or both that will provide some protection for our community,"" Ramstrom said.

Meanwhile, state Sen. Brian Dahle, who represents California's 1st Senate District, in a statement urged the governor to allow counties with few or no cases to reopen if they choose.

Shasta was the only county in far Northern California to report a new coronavirus case on Wednesday. On Tuesday, Mendocino County announced its first new confirmed case since March.

Here's where case totals stand among counties in the region as of late Wednesday evening.

The total number of confirmed cases in the state rose to 37,369 on Wednesday, according to the latest data by state health officials Thursday.Officials said 1,469 people in California have died as a result of contracting the coronavirus.

Here is how California’s coronavirus cases break down by age:

Health care workers made up 4,153 of the total cases, according to state officials.

The new statewide report said a disproportionate number of Latinos, African Americans and Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders are continuing to die from the disease for all age groups 18 and older, and men are dying more than women. It is line with national trends, with the notable exception of Asian females who are 65 and older where the difference is significantly higher. In particular, African American Californians have the highest death rate, which is about double their representation in the state's overall population, public health said. The state is not releasing specific numbers on the racial breakdown of cases.

Buachaill can be heard whimpering throughout the operation as the small cabin is lifted.

As the pump works its magic the family and fire department urge the Jack Russell to come out.

Eventually Buachaill crawls out from where he was trapped much to the delight of his owners.

The much loved pet doesn't seem fazed as he shakes it off before being lifted by his mother.

The video was posted by Wicklow Fire Service on Twitter and has been viewed over a thousand times.

In the post they said: “Buachaill” the Jack Russel over did the self isolation and got himself stuck under the garden shed in Kilcoole this morning.

""The Greystones crew didn’t raise the roof, the raised the whole shed.

""A normal day for a dog whose name might translate as Jack the Lad."""

Wolf’s business closure list,"Pennsylvania has closed businesses more aggressively than many nearby states. Democrats mostly agree with the approach, Republicans don’t.",whyy.org,"Curtis Alexander estimates that since coronavirus lockdowns began, he has lost around 90 percent of the business at his South Philadelphia garden store.

“This is our busy season, the spring,” he said.

Garden stores — even ones that sell food-producing plants — aren’t considered essential businesses in Pennsylvania and have been ordered to close. It is a point of contention in the industry — the Pennsylvania Nursery and Garden Association, for instance, is petitioning Gov. Tom Wolf to issue a blanket waiver letting the businesses continue operating.

Garden stores are the latest kinds of businesses that Republican state lawmakers have latched on to in hopes of pressuring the Wolf administration to let them reopen. They have drafted legislation that would reclassify garden centers as essential, as they are in some neighboring states.

Alexander’s store, Urban Jungle, actually received a waiver from the state that allowed it to keep operating. But he said it hasn’t really been the boon for his business that some GOP lawmakers seem to think it might be.

Most of the staff at Urban Jungle are furloughed right now. Alexander and his wife have been the only people working in the store regularly, and even then, mostly on the weekends, when they arrange curbside pickups with customers.

“I’m not going to endanger people — clients, employees, myself,” Alexander said. “I’m going to try to weather the storm. I may go bankrupt, I don’t know. I’m hanging in there right now.”

Business closures have varied widely by state. And though garden centers are the latest topic of debate in Harrisburg, they’re not the only category of closures that Republicans who control Pennsylvania’s House and Senate are criticizing.

Broadly, they want the list of businesses deemed essential and non-essential to hew more closely to a set of federal guidelines that the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency released in late March.

Some of the states that border Pennsylvania, like Maryland and Ohio, have appeared to rely more heavily on that guidance than Pennsylvania did. Ohio, for instance, based its definition of essential businesses on “all the workers identified in [the CISA memo] or any updated versions of [that memo].”"

 The World Health Organization (WHO) has identified Sri Lanka as being in stage 3 of contagion, which means that currently any new patients found are largely clustered at small community groups. To stop the shift to stage 4 (community transfer) the Government of Sri Lanka has proactively taken several aggressive steps, including extending curfew in identified hotspots like Colombo, Kandy, Kalutara and

This lockdown has undoubtedly helped curb the spread of COVID-19. However, the inevitable consequence of lockdowns, both locally and in our key export destinations, is a material economic cost; production and services have largely come to a temporary halt. Asia Securities’ recent Macroeconomic update attempts to estimate the GDP impact of COVID-19 by analyzing the impact of the pandemic on key sectors, the Government’s key fiscal and monetary measures, and the impact on Sri Lanka’s informal sector.



 We attempt to quantify the overall impact on GDP growth based on various pandemic containment scenarios. The results, unsurprisingly, suggest a high probability of the country’s most severe economic slowdown in modern times, not unlike the expectation for many other developed and developing nations across the world. With several unknowns affecting forecasts at this point of time, no historical analysis is meaningful for a direct comparison to the COVID-19 situation.



 As such, Asia Securities has used a triangulated top-down and bottom-up approach using quantitative and qualitative analysis, to put forward three possible scenarios; each depends entirely on the containment time and a reasonable return to “business as usual” both here at home in Sri Lanka, as well as in key export markets. Our top-down approach, which primarily looks at the overall impact on key sectors in the economy estimates a 5.0% - 5.4% YoY decline in GDP growth for 2020. This decline will be driven by the Industrials and Services sectors, which will see the highest impact stemming from productivity disruptions and global demand softening.



 Meanwhile, our bottoms-up approach combines input from our dedicated sector analysts covering manufacturing, consumer, financial services, and leisure sectors. The most likely scenario on this basis is an estimated 4.0% - 4.5% YoY decline in GDP growth for 2020. The table below summarises the COVID-19 containment and demand pick-up assumptions, as well as the resulting GDP outlook estimates for each forecast scenarios.



 Our best-case scenario forecasts real GDP in 2020 to be effectively similar to last year’s, with mild growth of 0.3-0.8%. This would be an exceptionally good outcome. Our most-probable case forecasts GDP to contract 4.0-4.5% in real terms. This is in a similar range to where we see some of our international partner firms and international rating agencies forecasts for several major economies.

In Scenario 1 (best-case), we assume that the virus will be contained by the end of April with a near-zero case number to continue for nearly two weeks. While local demand is expected to pick up by the end of May, we expect a gradual end market pick up from 2H 2020 on the external front. This scenario which sees a GDP growth of 0.3-0.8%, however, is the least probable. We estimate a 5-10% probability of this scenario unfolding.



 Scenario 2 (base-case) in which, say the virus is contained by the end of May (factoring in a second-wave of infections, similar to countries which have already contained the virus), which may indicate that there is a 60-75% probability of a GDP contraction of 4.0-4.5% YoY. This is based on the assumption of near-zero case number for nearly three weeks, which results in a largest impact on the Industrial sector. This scenario also hinges on the expectation of an end market pick up in the second half of the year for the industrial sector, which is expected to see a 19.7-23.0% decline in 2Q 2020.



 Scenario 3 explores the worst case, in which the virus containment arguably may take between five to six months, and a near-zero case number will continue for nearly 5-6 weeks. Local demand normalisation will take 4-5 months, and on the external front, we can expect a gradual end market pick up in the fourth quarter. This scenario estimates a 7.4-7.9% GDP decline. We estimate a 10-15% probability of this scenario unfolding.

Nearly 59% of Sri Lanka’s labour force receives some form of a variable income, and this income is currently under threat from lost business days. The current slowdown in economic activity and its impact on the informal sector calls for much needed fiscal assistance, which the government has proactively taken steps towards.



 The Government’s measures to impose price controls on essential items, introduction of food cards for lower-income households, and delayed payment periods for utility bills and other payments are all forward-looking policies which may help negate the fallout felt by those who are part of the informal sector.



 However, in our view, the Government will be a key player in ensuring that businesses do not face structural closures. In addition to supporting informal sector workers, protecting the operational viability of businesses will be key to minimising the risks of rising unemployment and declining production. 



 Limited fiscal space remains a concern



 In 2019 the fiscal deficit increased to 6.5% of GDP, up from 5.3% in 2018, as a result of lower government revenue and higher expenditure. Outstanding government debt increased 8.3% YoY to LKR 13tn, with foreign debt accounting for 49.1% of total debt. Lower direct taxes which are still in place, are expected to add to the mounting pressure on the fiscal deficit, which was already under duress following the sweeping tax cuts rolled out in November 2019 and January 2020. However, the recent revisions to PAYE (renamed as Advance Personal Income Tax) and corporate taxes will support government revenue to some extent.



 Last month, the Government took measures to finalise a $ 500 million 10-year loan from China Development Bank and has plans of extending this to a further $ 700 million in May. While we expect this to help the Government’s funding stress, additional funding from the IMF and the World Bank may help create some fiscal space for further support. In our view, re-negotiation of payment schedule is a key area the Government should focus on, during this point in time. While the Government has taken several pertinent measures to curtail the spread of COVID-19 in the country, swift implementation of fiscal assistance will be a key factor in avoiding a steeper, structural decline.

Clearly, the current unprecedented situation is fluid, and a range of outcomes related to the spread of the virus and containment could lead to a change in the economic forecasts. In addition, the pace of recovery in several key export markets, also impacts the outcome of our forecasts. While both the Government and Central Bank have stepped up to help ease the impact of the pandemic on the economy and country, we believe the Government’s fiscal stance is more effective in navigating the current scenario.



 The largest threat to our highest probability scenario comes from limited fiscal space. While more stimulus could cushion the GDP impact, we have limited visibility of additional funding available for the Government to afford more fiscal loosening in the near term.



 Any suggestion of additional sources of fiscal capacity for the Government will be a major positive, and in our view, can shift our growth outlook from the highest probability scenario of a 4.0-4.5% YoY GDP contraction to something closer to our best case scenario of 0.3-0.8% GDP growth. It is without doubt that the current dynamics are unprecedented, and fast changing. Any upside or downside surprises will have a material impact on our forecasts 



 with certainty."

Two more deaths were reported, and several hot spots worsened, including the Grand Island area, which reached 700 cases.

Nebraska now has 2,124 confirmed cases, up 311 from the previous day. The state had recorded a total of 47 deaths as of Thursday evening.

A number of counties saw a large jump in numbers, according to state and local health departments. Notably:

» Dakota County, an increase of 133 to a total of 246 infections.

» Hall County, where Grand Island is, an increase of 62 to a total of 664.

» Dawson County, where Lexington is, an increase of 58 cases to a total of 256.

In Hall County, a man in his 60s became the Central District Health Department’s 19th death. The district covers Hall, Hamilton and Merrick Counties. Hall County has largest number of cases in the state.

Details on Nebraska’s other confirmed death weren’t immediately available.

Douglas County added 23 cases for a total of 348 people with confirmed infections, according to the Douglas County Health Department. Two of the people among the newly confirmed cases are known to be hospitalized. As of Thursday night, 61 people in the county were hospitalized with COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. A total of 14 people have died in Douglas County.

The latest Douglas County cases involve people ranging in age from 17 to 69. Seven people had contact with a known infected person, five acquired the illness in the community and 11 infections remain under investigation.

Across the Missouri River in Pottawattamie County, two additional cases were reported, bringing the total there to 20. Of those, 17 people have recovered, two are self-isolating at home, and one has died.

The two new cases are a man and woman in the 41-to-60 age range. One had preexisting conditions and contact with a known infection. The other has no preexisting conditions and no known contact with others who were infected.

And while the Lincoln-Lancaster area saw a much more modest increase, it surpassed 100 cases on Thursday.

Mayor Leirion Gaylor Baird said the county has recorded 106 cases and one death.

The Lincoln-Lancaster County Health Department reported that the new cases consisted of a young child, and five women and three men ranging in age from their 20s to 50s, according to Health Director Pat Lopez. Three Lancaster County residents are hospitalized, and one is on a ventilator.

The counties with the most cases, in order, are Hall, Douglas, Dawson, Dakota, Adams and Lancaster Counties."

Public health requires gradually increasing the lumens but even at full power, some businesses will not shine as brightly and others are permanently broken.

Crowded theaters, schools and airplanes risk re-igniting the epidemic, especially in states where governors imposed work-at-home orders early and residents have not acquired broad immunity.

Even in New York, New Orleans and other hotspots, folks who managed to go unexposed to COVID-19 are vulnerable to asymptomatic neighbors and coworkers — unless authorities can roll out reasonably comprehensive testing to determine immunity, quarantining for asymptomatic individuals carrying the virus and personal surveillance.

Cellphones with bluetooth-enabled apps could log our movements and personal contacts to enable quick identification and testing or quarantining those exposed as new infections are detected. Only electronically tracking personal interactions will permit us to ride buses and elevators, work in offices and factories and visit restaurants without risking a second wave of infections. Without it, the economy remains in low gear.

Americans may balk but should accept these intrusions, because Google, Facebook, Twitter and cellphone companies already collect data to place ads for tires and tights on the web searches and in emails of bikers and exercisers.

I trust politicians a lot more with that kind of private information than CEOs — they are less insular and subject to better oversight and removal.

We can’t afford not to trust the government. If the economy stays closed through May, unemployment — measured and hidden — will likely jump well above 20 percent and that implies a $5 trillion-plus drop in wages and productivity. Enhanced unemployment benefits, federal loans and grants to businesses and private borrowing are creating a mountain of debt similar to the financial crisis.

All that will radically limit consumer spending, businesses’ investment and state and local government budgets for the next five years. And if we wait until we have reliable, widely available effective coronavirus treatments and a vaccine, Americans will be reliving “The Grapes of Wrath.”

The shutdown is radically changing consumer and business spending habits — permanently. More folks who visited restaurants after tough days on the job have discovered delivered meals from virtual restaurants industrial kitchens — 25 percent of the sit-down eateries now closed may never reopen.

Zoom is hardly perfect but overloaded servers and security vulnerabilities can be fixed — or Zoom will be replaced by something better. And businesses have discovered they can get along subjecting employees to fewer crowded, tawdry and unhealthy experiences on airplanes.

This whole episode has accelerated the growth of Amazon, Walmart and Target at the expense of conventional brick-and-mortar stores, the advent of machine and software robots, widespread tele-medicine and education, watching movies and working at home, and the retreat of automobiles.

Unfortunately, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (CARES) might have better been labeled Project Brigadoon, because it emphasizes subsidizing businesses to maintain pre-existing payrolls, union contracts and the like, and assumes the economy can be reawakened to its condition in February.

Unemployment benefits that exceed weekly pay encourages larger companies to lay off employees and for those workers to wait for old jobs to return, but many businesses are permanently closed or scaled back. Many loans the Treasury, Small Business Administration and Federal Reserve have underwritten will fail, and grants to keep workers in place will prove absolutely wasted.

Expanded unemployment benefits are set to end in July but in an election year, the pressures to continue holding the economy in suspended animation will be intense and mistaken.

As businesses will be terribly burdened by debt, workers in need of retraining and the economy requiring vast new investments to accommodate new patterns of consumer and business spending, it would be better to focus more on expanding and building new enterprises.

Starting in August, the federal government should simply give each American $1,200 a month — no questions asked — and each business — new, old or in the planning stages $1,200 per month per employee and permit 10 percent additional, refundable tax credits on investment — for 18 months.

By then, we will have a vaccine and effective therapies in wide use. The economy won’t be as good as new, but it would be better refurbished than by pursuing policies premised on nostalgia for an economy long gone.

In support of these efforts, EPA now has nearly 400 products that have qualified to be effective against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. This week the agency also published an overview of its actions and resources related to disinfection against the novel coronavirus.

“EPA is dedicated to its mission of protecting human health and we want all Americans to have access to effective and approved surface disinfectant products,” said Alexandra Dapolito Dunn, assistant administrator of EPA’s Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention. “We also want everyone follow the directions on the product so that we can safely use registered disinfectants and provide critical protection to our families.”

When using an EPA-registered surface disinfectant, always follow the product’s directions and remember:

Never apply the product to yourself or others. Do not ingest disinfectant products. This includes never applying any product on List N (the agency’s list of disinfectants to use against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19) directly to food.

Never mix products unless specified in the use directions. Certain combinations of chemicals will create highly toxic acids or gases.

Wash the surface with soap and water before applying disinfectant products if the label mentions pre-cleaning.

Follow the contact time listed for your product on List N. This is the amount of time the surface must remain visibly wet to ensure efficacy against the virus. It can sometimes be several minutes.

Wash your hands after using a disinfectant. This will minimize your exposure to the chemicals in the disinfectant and the pathogen you are trying to kill.

EPA provides additional information on disinfectant safety messages on its twitter feeds, @EPA and @EPAChemSafety. These channels will be updated with new materials throughout the COVID-19 crisis.

EPA is also continuing to add additional chemicals to its list of commodity inert ingredients. These actions are intended to help address supply chain issues for EPA-registered disinfectants and other pesticides. It allows manufacturers of already-registered EPA products to change the source of listed inert ingredients.

A man who attended the annual CES convention in Las Vegas in January has just learned that he was infected with coronavirus at the time. The attendee was Michael Webber, a 49-year-old who divides time between Texas and France. He learned this week that he had been infected with the virus and recovered.

A confirmed infected CES attendee should give pause to the 170,000 people who attended the annual technology conference between January 7th and the 10th in Las Vegas. The four-day event is huge in the technology realm and attracts people from all around the world. Coronavirus could've incubated during CES and spread globally when attendees went home. That is still conjecture at this time, but Webber's disclosure that he had coronavirus while attending the annual conference is the first direct confirmation that the virus was likely circulating at the show.

Officials are beginning to see that the virus may have been spreading around the world before previously believed. Health officials in Northern California recently confirmed a coronavirus death that happened in early February. For that person to have died in February, they're believed to have likely contracted the disease in January. Health officials in the area are still investigating and expect additional confirmed cases in the Santa Clara County area.

Santa Clara County, which includes Silicon Valley, was an early hotspot, and the reasons for that was a mystery. However, there were more than 150 companies that call Santa Clara County home that attended CES. Some believe the convention could have served as the perfect breeding ground for the coronavirus allowing it to spread before people were paying attention. The event organizers noted that over 100 people attended CES 2020 from Wuhan, China, which was the epicenter for coronavirus early on. Many people who attended the conference and fell ill during or after likely attributed it to the so-called ""CES flu,"" which seems to infect some attendees each year, never considering coronavirus as the cause. Authorities are still investigating at this time."

A black megachurch pastor in Atlanta has attacked Gov. Brian Kemp’s (R) plan to open small businesses during the coronavirus pandemic as an ""assault on the minority community” and “contrary to God’s will.”

“Gov. Kemp, if you have a decibel of moral integrity, before Friday comes, I am pleading on your conscience, even when the evangelicals remain silent in this hour, I stand and cry loud and spare not, that what it is you are calling for is contrary to the will of God who declared openly ‘I came that you might have life and have it more abundantly,’” said Jamal Bryant, pastor of New Birth Missionary Baptist Church, in a Facebook Live broadcast Tuesday night.

“I am calling on Gov. Kemp to immediately reverse and retract his order that is supposed to start on Friday. What it is that he is doing is launching, in no uncertain terms, an assault on the minority community in Georgia.”

Bryant said he was banding with several other prominent black pastors across the state, including Raphael Warnock, E. Dewey Smith and William Murphy, to keep their churches shuttered in a united show of resistance.

“I am afraid and I am frightened that this is going to set an immoral precedent for other wayward governors across the South who believe that if he can do it, then it is in fact the new standard for death to happen to the black community.""

Bryant pointed out that black and brown Americans are still disproportionately dying from the new coronavirus due to higher levels of underlying health conditions and lower access to healthcare. He also pointed to issues of lower levels of testing for the virus in minority communities.

Two blacks on Kemps economic task force, Bernice King, CEO of The King Center in Atlanta and daughter of Martin Luther King Jr., and Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, resigned. They said they were not informed of the governor’s decision beforehand. Many Georgia mayors also said they were not consulted in advance.

Among the businesses that can begin reopening on Friday are fitness centers, bowling alleys, body art studios, barber shops, cosmetologists, hair designers, nail care artists, their respective schools and massage therapists.

Theaters, private social clubs and dine-in services at restaurants will also be allowed to reopen on April 27 with specific social distancing guidelines and sanitation mandates. Bars, nightclubs, amusement parks and live performance venues, however, will remain closed."

A full list of rating actions is below. The Outlook revision…",nuclear-news.net,"The Outlook revision mainly reflects a large production cut in nuclear generation in France related to the coronavirus pandemic, and ongoing problems with new nuclear, adding to an expected increase in leverage to slightly above our rating sensitivity on average for 2020-2022. It also reflects growing uncertainties about the nuclear-market reform in France – which we still expect to be finally implemented – in terms of timing and final impact.

Production Cuts due to Pandemic: The pandemic and the lockdown have caused daily electricity demand to fall up to 20% yoy and depressed both spot and forward electricity prices. EDF has announced a cut of French nuclear production to 300TWh in 2020 and to 330TWh-360TWh for 2021-2022 (from our earlier assumption of 385TWh annually for the whole period), due mainly to the operational impact of the pandemic on the outages scheduled for these years and, to a lesser extent, to the drop in demand. While the announcement led to a rebound of forward prices 2021-2022 to around 45EUR/MWh, we do not expect EDF to fully benefit from it due to the ARENH reference price of 42EUR/MWh. For 2020, EDF is largely protected from the low price environment through hedging.

Large Working Capital Outflows: Another immediate consequence of the pandemic has been an increase in the number of end-customers struggling to pay their bills. In this respect, EDF will continue to supply power to households and small companies with overdue bills without penalties. ,……..

Company’s Reaction Uncertain: EDF has not yet communicated revised financial targets to the market, and we do not know what actions it will focus on to mitigate the impact of the pandemic. …….

Problems with New Nuclear: At Flamanville, fuel loading would occur at best at end-2022 (compared with the previously estimated late-2019), implying an increase of construction costs by EUR1.5 billion (in 2015 real terms and excluding interests during construction) compared with previous estimates. HPC – the other key nuclear project of EDF – following another cost review in September 2019, sees an increase in construction costs of GBP1.9 billion-GBP2.9 billion (2015 real terms) compared with previous estimates. It remains to be seen if the pandemic will further increase the delay and cost overrun for these projects…….. https://www.fitchratings.com/research/corporate-finance/fitch-revises-edf-outlook-to-negative-affirms-idr-at-a-22-04-2020"

Is this true, and what accounts for the difference?

Answer: We have known for some time that older folks and those with pre-existing medical conditions – such as heart disease, diabetes and obesity – face an elevated risk of suffering a severe and potentially fatal reaction if they become infected with the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19.

But a growing body of evidence from COVID-19 hot spots around the world suggests that a person’s sex is also a significant factor in determining their chance of survival.

In China, 64 per cent of the recorded deaths were among men, compared with only 36 per cent among women. A similar pattern has emerged in other countries. In Italy, for instance, men accounted for 71 per cent of deaths, while in Germany they represented 66 per cent.

‘Can I take my kids to the park?’ And more coronavirus questions answered by André Picard

Officially known as SARS-CoV-2, this cornonavirus is so new that researchers cannot say with any certainty why infected men are at a greater risk of death than women.

“This is all very speculative,” says Dr. Cara Tannenbaum, scientific director of the Institute of Gender and Health at the Canadian Institutes of Health Research in Montreal.

Some experts believe that the reason for the stark divergence in mortality rates might be found in the fact that the immune systems of men and women are not identical.

Previous research has clearly identified sex-based immune-system differences, says Dr. Juan Carlos Zuniga-Pflucker, a senior scientist at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre and chair of the Department of Immunology at the University of Toronto.

One key reason for sex-based differences is pregnancy – a time when a woman essentially has a foreign entity growing inside her body. Without the ability to modify or dampen its response, the immune system would reject the developing fetus, he says.

Over all, “women tend to have a more distinctly regulated version of the immune system,” he says. This tendency can sometimes increase a woman’s chances of getting certain diseases, such as lupus and multiple sclerosis. “But it may be beneficial in responding to a virus like this one,” he adds.

Indeed, an overactive or overaggressive immune response appears to be contributing to many COVID-19 deaths – and that may account for a higher number of fatalities among men. It might also explain why some relatively young and apparently healthy individuals are brought down by the illness.

At this point, it’s worth reviewing what we do know about COVID-19.

The infection usually starts when the virus enters the upper airway. It invades a cell and then takes over the cellular machinery to start churning out copies of itself. In some patients, there may be limited viral replication in the upper airway, but in others, replication may include the lungs and be associated with more severe disease.

The lungs are extremely vulnerable. The virus can damage the air sacs called alveoli, where blood normally picks up oxygen to be distributed to the rest of the body.

As the infection gains steam, the immune system starts marshalling its resources for a counterattack.

The immune system is made up of numerous specialized cells. Many of them produce cytokines, which are chemical messengers that help direct a co-ordinated assault on the microbial invader. But for reasons that are not fully understood, the immune system sometimes produces too many, leading to what is called a “cytokine storm.”

As more and more immune cells converge on the lungs, they generate additional cytokines that then call for reinforcements. They create a “feedback loop” that intensifies the immune response, Zuniga-Pflucker says.

“Under these circumstances, the cytokines end up causing collateral damage and normal cells end up being harmed,” says Dr. Samira Mubareka, an infectious-diseases physician and virologist at Sunnybrook.

At the same time, cytokines cause vascular leakage from surrounding tissues and fluid begins filling the lungs.

“It becomes harder and harder for patients to get enough air into their lungs,” Mubareka says. Some of these people will develop a life-threatening condition called acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

But the lungs are not the only parts of the body harmed by the virus. Many patients experience heart, kidney and liver problems, as well as gastrointestinal and central nervous system abnormalities. Whether the virus is directly invading these other tissues isn’t yet clear. They might be compromised simply because oxygen levels in the blood are plummeting. Whatever the cause, patients can develop another potentially life-threatening condition: multiorgan system failure.

Although men, in general, are more likely than women to succumb to COVID-19, there is still a lot of individual variability. After all, some infected men die, some don’t. So, that suggests the infected person’s genetics may play a role.

“We won’t know which [genetic] variants are important until we do large-scale population-wide genome studies, where we compare a lot people who had serious outcomes to those with mild disease,” Mubareka says.

Plans are already under way to do such studies. But it will take some time before we have a full understanding of why this illness is not an equal-opportunity killer.

Four months in, this year has already been a remarkable showcase for existential and catastrophic risk. A severe drought, devastating bushfires, hazardous smoke, towns running dry – these events all demonstrate the consequences of human-induced climate change.

While the above may seem like isolated threats, they are parts of a larger puzzle of which the pieces are all interconnected. A report titled Surviving and Thriving in the 21st Century, published today by the Commission for the Human Future, has isolated ten potentially catastrophic threats to human survival.

Not prioritised over one another, these risks are:
• collapse of ecosystems and loss of biodiversity
• chemical pollution of the Earth system, including the atmosphere and oceans
• nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction
• pandemics of new and untreatable disease
• the advent of powerful, uncontrolled new technology
• national and global failure to understand and act preventatively on these risks.

The Commission for the Human Future formed last year, following earlier discussions within emeritus faculty at the Australian National University about the major risks faced by humanity, how they should be approached and how they might be solved. We hosted our first round-table discussion last month, bringing together more than 40 academics, thinkers and policy leaders.

The commission’s report states our species’ ability to cause mass harm to itself has been accelerating since the mid-20th century. Global trends in demographics, information, politics, warfare, climate, environmental damage and technology have culminated in an entirely new level of risk.

The risks emerging now are varied, global and complex. Each one poses a “significant” risk to human civilisation, a “catastrophic risk”, or could actually extinguish the human species and is therefore an “existential risk”.

The risks are interconnected. They originate from the same basic causes and must be solved in ways that make no individual threat worse. This means many existing systems we take for granted, including our economic, food, energy, production and waste, community life and governance systems – along with our relationship with the Earth’s natural systems – must undergo searching examination and reform.

It’s tempting to examine these threats individually, and yet with the coronavirus crisis we see their interconnection.

The response to the coronavirus has had implications for climate change with carbon pollution reduction, increased discussion about artificial intelligence and use of data (including facial recognition), and changes to the landscape of global security particularly in the face of massive economic transition.

It’s not possible to “solve” COVID-19 without affecting other risks in some way.

The commission’s report does not aim to solve each risk, but rather to outline current thinking and identify unifying themes. Understanding science, evidence and analysis will be key to adequately addressing the threats and finding solutions. An evidence-based approach to policy has been needed for many years. Under-appreciating science and evidence leads to unmitigated risks, as we have seen with climate change.

The human future involves us all. Shaping it requires a collaborative, inclusive and diverse discussion. We should heed advice from political and social scientists on how to engage all people in this conversation.

Imagination, creativity and new narratives will be needed for challenges that test our civil society and humanity. The bushfire smoke over the summer was unprecedented, and COVID-19 is a new virus.

If our policymakers and government had spent more time using the available climate science to understand and then imagine the potential risks of the 2019-20 summer, we would have recognised the potential for a catastrophic season and would likely have been able to prepare better. Unprecedented events are not always unexpected.

The short-termism of our political process needs to be circumvented. We must consider how our actions today will resonate for generations to come.

The commission’s report highlights the failure of governments to address these threats and particularly notes the short-term thinking that has increasingly dominated Australian and global politics. This has seriously undermined our potential to decrease risks such as climate change.

The shift from short to longer term thinking can began at home and in our daily lives. We should make decisions today that acknowledge the future, and practise this not only in our own lives but also demand it of our policy makers.

We’re living in unprecedented times. The catastrophic and existential risks for humanity are serious and multifaceted. And this conversation is the most important one we have today.

Job losses in aviation and related industries could grow to 3.1 million. That is half of the region’s 6.2 million aviation-related employment. The previous estimate was 2 million, it said.

Full-year 2020 traffic is expected to plummet by 51 per cent compared to 2019. Previous estimate was a fall of 32 per cent, Iata said.

GDP supported by aviation in the region could fall by $28 billion from $56 billion. Previous estimate was $17.8 billion.

These estimates are based on a scenario of severe travel restrictions lasting for three months, with a gradual lifting of restrictions in domestic markets, followed by regional and intercontinental.
• South Africa: 14.5 million fewer passengers resulting in a $3.02 billion revenue loss, risking 252,100 jobs and $5.1 billion in contribution to South Africa’s economy
• Nigeria: 4.7 million fewer passengers resulting in a$0.99 billion revenue loss, risking 125,400 jobs and $0.89 billion in contribution to Nigeria’s economy
• Ethiopia: 2.5 million fewer passengers resulting in a $0.43 billion revenue loss, risking 500,500 jobs and $1.9 billion in contribution to Ethiopia’s economy
• Kenya: 3.5 million fewer passengers resulting in a $0.73 billion revenue loss, risking 193,300 jobs and $1.6 billion in contribution to Kenya’s economy
• Tanzania: 1.5 million fewer passengers resulting in a $0.31billion revenue loss, risking 336,200 jobs and $1.5 billion in contribution to Tanzania’s economy
• Mauritius: 3.5 million fewer passengers resulting in a $0.54 billion revenue loss, risking 73,700 jobs and $2 billion in contribution to Mauritius’ economy
• Mozambique: 1.4 million fewer passengers resulting in a $0.13 billion revenue loss, risking 126,400 jobs and $0.2 billion in contribution to Mozambique’s economy
• Ghana: 2.8 million fewer passengers resulting in a $0.38 billion revenue loss, risking 284,300 jobs and $1.6 billion in contribution to Ghana’s economy
• Senegal: 2.6 million fewer passengers resulting in a $0.33 billion revenue loss, risking 156,200 jobs and $0.64 billion in contribution to Senegal’s economy
• Cape Verde: 2.2 million fewer passengers resulting in a $0.2 billion revenue loss, risking 46,700 jobs and $0.48 billion in contribution to Nigeria’s economy

To minimise the impact on jobs and the broader African economy, it is vital that governments step up their efforts to aid the industry. Some governments in Africa have already taken direct action to support aviation, including:
• Senegal announced $128 million in relief for the Tourism and Air Transport sector
• Seychelles has waived all landing and parking fees for April to December
• Cote d’Ivoire has waived its Tourism Tax for transit passengers
• As part of its economic support intervention, South Africa is deferring payroll, income and carbon taxes across all industries, which will also benefit airlines domiciled in that country

But more help is needed. IATA is calling for a mixture of:
• Loans, loan guarantees and support for the corporate bond market

Iata has also appealed to development banks and other sources of finance to support Africa’s air transport sectors which are now on the verge of collapse.

“Airlines in Africa are struggling for survival. Air Mauritius has entered voluntary administration, South African Airways and SA Express are in business rescue, other distressed carriers have placed staff on unpaid leave or signaled their intention to cut jobs. More airlines will follow if urgent financial relief is not provided. The economic damage of a crippled industry extends far beyond the sector itself. Aviation in Africa supports 6.2 million jobs and $56 billion in GDP. Sector failure is not an option, more governments need to step up,” said Muhammad Al Bakri, Iata’s regional vice president for Africa and the Middle East.

In addition to vital financial relief, the industry will also need careful planning and coordination to ensure that airlines are ready when the pandemic is contained.

Iata is scoping a comprehensive approach to re-starting the industry when governments and public health authorities allow. A series of virtual regional summits, bringing together governments and industry stakeholders are taking place this week. The main objectives will be:
• Understanding what is needed to re-open closed borders, and
• Agreeing solutions that can be operationalized and scaled efficiently

“As governments struggle to contain the Covid-19 pandemic, an economic catastrophe has unfolded. Re-starting aviation and opening borders will be critical to the eventual economic recovery. Airlines are eager to get back to business when and in a way that it is safe. But starting up will be complicated. We need to make sure that the system is ready, have a clear vision of what is needed for a safe travel experience, establish passenger confidence and find ways to restore demand.""

""Cooperation and harmonization across borders will be essential to restart aviation,” said Al Bakri. - TradeArabia News Service"
33,33,https://www.workers.org/2020/04/47917/,COVID-19 and the crisis of the elderly,,www.workers.org,"This Texas city rarely makes national news. But since the outbreak of COVID-19, the so-called River City has made the national news twice.

The later one was the poignant scene on April 9 of 10,000 families lined up for a food bank distribution. The scene exposed the crisis of hunger in this country.

The first national news, however, was the case of a nursing home, the Southeast Nursing and Rehabilitation Center, in the predominantly Brown and Black southeast part of this city. News reports on April 1 stated that residents and staff at the facility had tested positive for COVID-19.

Since then, 17 of the elderly residents have died from the virus, and 28 of the staff have been infected or become sick.

KENS radio website noted that during the facility’s last government inspection in 2019, Medicare gave it “one out of five stars.” (April 15)

Many have written that “a country is judged by how it treats its frailest members.” How sad that after having the chance and privilege of living a long life, workers are considered dispensable and disposable, simply because they are no longer able to produce wealth for the bosses.

COVID-19 has laid bare for the world to see that the capitalist system is incapable and unwilling to take care of its sick or vulnerable, including the elderly. COVID-19 substantiates that a “for-profit” decentralized health care system must be abolished. And it must be abolished now.

Early on in the COVID outbreak, Seattle was hit, and it too had a nightmarish outbreak at a nursing home, where beginning Feb. 26 more than two dozen residents died. The New York Times said: “The outbreak … exposed the great vulnerability of the nation’s nursing homes and assisted living facilities, and the 2.5 million people who live in them.” (March 4)

The article continued: “These institutions have been under increasing scrutiny … for a unique role they play in inflaming epidemics. Research shows these homes can be poorly staffed and plagued by lax infection-control practices, and … residents frequently cycle to and from hospitals, bringing germs back and forth.”

At the San Antonio facility where COVID-19 surfaced on April 1, workers were found to “work at 10 other nursing homes” at the same time, also showing the brutal schedule of low-wage caregivers. (KSAT News) More headlines continued to reveal the crisis.

On April 15, a New York Times article announced, “After Anonymous Tip, 17 Bodies Are Found at Nursing Home Hit by Virus.” It added, “There have been 68 recent deaths of residents and nurses from the facility in a small New Jersey town.”

The next day, the newspaper headlined: “29 Dead at One Nursing Home from the Virus. Or More. No One Will Say” about a nursing home in Queens, N.Y.

Imagine the pain, uncertainty and fear of the families of those elders. Imagine not being able to hold your mother or wife or partner, one last time. Imagine the horror of not knowing how your loved one spent their last moments on Earth, or the sadness of not being there to comfort your loved ones because (correctly so) nursing homes are suddenly on lockdown.

In 2000 the Department of Health and Human Services stated: “People are dying … because they don’t get enough water and nutrition into their system. … A congressional report says 1,600 U.S. nursing homes — nearly one-third — have been cited for abuse.” (CBS News, July 20, 2001)

Nineteen years later on April 18, a Washington Post article wrote: “Forty percent of more than 650 nursing homes … with publicly reported cases of the coronavirus have been cited more than once … in recent years for violating federal standards meant to control the spread of infections.”

These violations included “unsafe conditions that can trigger the spread of flu, pneumonia, urinary tract infections and skin diseases. Dozens were flagged by inspectors only months before the coronavirus pandemic struck the United States.”

The facilities that had broken federal regulation standards for safe conditions and now had COVID-19 deaths included Pleasant View Nursing Home in Maryland where “24 people had died” of the virus; the Canterbury Rehabilitation and Healthcare Center near Richmond, Va., with 49 deaths; and a center in southwestern Pennsylvania where “officials have warned that all 750 residents and staff members could be infected.”

The staff at these institutions cannot be blamed for the problems, even if some have carried out antisocial behavior while performing health care duties. In reality, it is the capitalist system that is at fault, not the health care workers.

If these nursing homes had already been cited, where was the government follow-up to make sure corrections had been made?

Low pay, lack of training, difficult hours and demanding tasks make the care of our elderly challenging under capitalism. It is not easy to deal with diaper changes or bed sores for adults, especially if the patient has dementia.

Nonetheless, there are reports after reports that health care workers are going out of their way to tend to the needs of the elderly, despite low pay. Countless family members sing the praises of certified nurses assistants, nurses, receptionists, administrators and others who take time to FaceTime or Skype residents with their family members on the outside during this period. That is beyond the call of duty.

The care of the elderly is a very important job that requires skill and, one would dare say, tenderness. The job — really the career — should provide quality training and pay extremely well.

This is not likely to happen without a mass struggle. COVID-19 must lay the basis for that struggle.

Under socialism the elderly would not be thrown out to pasture. Elders would be seen as a source of pride, wisdom and history; they would be treasured as they are, for example, in Indigenous communities.

Silvia Federici, professor emerita and a teaching fellow at Hofstra University, challenges the left to make the demand of care for our elders part of the struggle for socialism.

In “On Elder Care Work and the Limits of Marxism,” Federici writes: “Care work … especially eldercare, has come in recent years to the center of public attention … in response to a number of trends that have put many traditional forms of assistance into crisis. First among these trends has been the growth … of the old- age population and the increase in life expectancy which has not been matched by a growth of services … for the old.”

One key factor, she writes, is “gentrification … that has destroyed the support networks and forms of mutual aid on which older people living alone could once rely, as neighbors would bring food, make beds, come for a chat.”

“As a result,” she continues, “… it is now recognized that for a large number of elderly, the positive effects of a longer life-span have been voided or clouded by the prospect of loneliness, social exclusion and increased vulnerability to physical and psychological abuse.”

She appeals to the left to make the question of elder care part and parcel of the work of Marxists and revolutionaries: “The struggle over elder care must be politicized and placed on the agenda of social justice movements. A cultural revolution is also necessary in the concept of old age, challenging its degradation as a fiscal burden on the state and the younger generations (on one side), and (on the other) its mystification as an ‘optional’ stage in life that we can ‘cure,’ ‘overcome,’ and even prevent.”

The road to socialism will be multigenerational

When one considers the shortened lifespan in the Global South or among prisoners, the homeless, in oppressed U.S. communities, it is right to conclude that growing old is now a privilege.

Young people today face one existential crisis after another. The climate crisis alone evokes the question: How long do even millennials have on this planet?

But in struggle after struggle — whether fighting against climate change or a lack of health care or fighting to raise the minimum wage — we see young and old hand in hand.

The generations may not always understand each other’s languages in entirety, but young revolutionaries understand that any benefit they have was built on the shoulders of their elders.

And elders — despite back pains and other tolls of aging — have all along fought to change society for future generations.

A better world is indeed in birth. Whether elders on the left live long enough to see that world, they will nonetheless go down fighting for socialism — until death.

The Foo Fighters frontman is known for showing his emotions, but he's gotten particularly teary when his singles get covered.

Dave Grohl penned Times Like These for Foo Fighters' fourth album One by One, with bandmates Taylor Hawkins, Nate Mendel and Chris Shiflett also on the writing credits.

The track was released on 14 January 2003, but it's been a staple of the Foos setlist for almost two decades and never fails to get the crowd feeling emotional.

The song still gives big Dave the feels when it's sung back to him, but it reduces him to tears when it gets the cover treatment- as with his other anthems. Find out why here.

How Times Like These and other Foo Fighters' have moved Dave Grohl to tears

Dave Grohl and co were famously set to play Glastonbury Festival in 2015, when he fell off stage and broke his leg just before, forcing the band to cancel their shows while he had emergency surgery.

Florence + The Machine were moved up the slot, taking on the headlining duties instead. Much to everyone's surprise Florence Welch paid tribute to the rocker by singing a rendition of Times Like These.

Dave Grohl reveals he cried at Florence + The Machine's Glasto tribute

Recalling how he cried when watching her performance, Grohl told Radio X's Gordon Smart: ""I remember when I heard that Florence + The Machine were playing I was really excited because I love them and I love her, and knowing that they were taking our place made me really happy.""

He added: ""And then I heard that they did a cover of our song, Times Like These, and I was in a wheelchair with my laptop listening to it, and it really got me choked up man. Tears started coming down my face. Not (because) I’d missed the show, but it was such a touching moment for me personally.""

When the Foos managed to finally headline Glastonbury festival in 2017, Dave sang the song back as a tribute to Florence's performance.

One of the most high profile Foos covers occurred when Prince put his stamp on Best of You during his Super Bowl half-time show in 2007.

When Grohl was told The Purple One was set to cover his track, he sort of refused to believe it, opting not to watch his iconic half-time show because he didn't believe it was real.

It wasn't until a stranger had passed him on the street telling him Prince covered his track that he believed it had truly happened.

Talking about watching it back, Grohl recalled: ""I was stunned. In shock. Flooded with emotion. As my tears hit the keyboard like the Miami rain that night, I realized this was without a doubt my proudest musical achievement.""

Sometimes covers touch the rocker so much, he ends up playing a gig for whoever's behind them.

Back in 2015, the Rockin' 1000 performed a MAMMOTH version of Foo Fighters' Learn To Fly in a bid to get the band to play a gig in their hometown of Cesina, Italy.

A statement on their website read ""The Foo Fighters are not in Romagna since 1997, it’s time to get them back, but we need a crazy idea.

""We have to organize something that kicks ass worldwide and can be seen by Dave Grohl: We will ask one thousand rockers to play one of their songs, all together and at the same time.""

Grohl replied to them, in rather Italian thanking the musicians that made it possible.

His message roughly translates to: ""Hi, Cesena! I am David, hello. I’m sorry, I don’t speak Italian. Only a little, a little. That video - but how beautiful! Very beautiful. A thousand thanks. We are coming, I promise. We’ll see each other soon. Thank you very much. I love you. Bye.""

In the end, the Rockin' 1000's hard work paid off, as the band did end up playing a gig for their home town in late 2015, with Dave still wearing a cast.

Naturally Dave thanked them by opening the gig with... you guessed it... Learn To Fly!

He told the crowd: ""First of all we have to say thank you to all of the musicians here tonight. It's crazy.""What you guys did. The whole world saw what you did... It was a beautiful thing.""

He added: ""To see you people singing our song for the whole fucking world... It was the greatest moment.""So, of course we couldn't say no. We had to come here.""

37,37,https://dailytimes.ng/covid-19-faac-shares-n780bn-for-march-amid-decline-in-oil-revenue/,COVID-19: FAAC shares N780bn for March amid decline in oil revenue —,,dailytimes.ng,"In spite of the sharp drop in the nation’s oil revenue, and the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federation Accounts Allocation Committee (FAAC) on Wednesday shared a total sum N 780.9 billion for March 2020 Federation Account Revenue.

This was confirmed in a statement from the office of the Accountant-General of the Federation at the end of the virtual FAAC meeting of the representatives of the federal, states and local governments, along with Federal Capital Territory counterparts.

According to the statement: “The N780.926 billion comprised Statutory Revenue, Value Added Tax (VAT), and Exchange Gain.”

It was also revealed the balance in the Excess Crude Account (ECA) grew a little to $72.221 million.

The gross statutory revenue for the month of March 2020 was put at N 597.676 billion.

This was higher than the N466.058 billion received in February 2020 by N131.618 billion.

Value Added Tax (VAT) yielded gross revenue of N120.268 billion in March 2020 as against N99.552 billion in February 2020, resulting in an increase of N20.716 billion.

A total of N62.928 billion was available from Exchange Gain in the month under review.

The OAGF also stated that: “The Statement of Accounts indicated that from the total revenue of N780.926 billion, the Federal Government received N264.330 billion.”

Continuing, the Office said: “The State Governments received N181.487 billion, and the Local Government Councils received N135.950 billion.

“The Oil Producing States received N38.751 billion as 13 per cent derivation revenue while the cost of revenue collection by Revenue Agencies and allocation to North-East Development Commission (NEDC) was N160.408 billion.”

According to the Statement of Accounts, the Federal Government received N217.773 billion from the gross statutory revenue of N597.676 billion.

The State Governments received N110.457 billion and the Local Government Councils received N85.158 billion.

The sum of N32.299 billion was given to the relevant States as 13 per cent derivation revenue and N151.989 billion as cost of revenue collection by Revenue Agencies and allocation to NEDC.

The federal government received N16.777 billion from the Value Added Tax (VAT) revenue of N120.268 billion available in the month of March 2020. The State Governments received N55.925 billion, the Local Government Councils received N39.147 billion, while the cost of collection by Revenue Agencies and allocation to NEDC was N8.419 billion.

The Statement confirmed that the Federal Government received N29.780 billion, the State Governments received N15.105 billion, the Local Government Councils received N11.645 billion and the Oil Producing States received N6.452 billion from the total revenue of N62.982 billion available from Exchange Gain.

It also disclosed that in the month of March 2020, Petroleum Profit Tax (PPT), Companies Income Tax (CIT), Import and Excise Duties, Oil and Gas Royalties and Value Added Tax (VAT) all recorded substantial increases which resulted in the large volume of money shared.

The monthly Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) meeting for the month of April 2020, where the sharing of the March 2020 revenues was discussed, was held through virtual conferencing in line with the physical distancing directive by the Nigeria Center for Disease Control (NCDC)."

A well-done, recognizable logo rapidly identifies the brand and connects consumer to product.",www.mankatofreepress.com,"Logos have power. A well-done, recognizable logo rapidly identifies the brand and connects consumer to product.

So it was no snap decision for Minnesota-based Land O’Lakes to part ways with “Mia,” the Indian woman who has for generations decorated the dairy cooperative’s packaging.

Land O’Lakes did not make a splashy announcement about the change. It simply started phasing out Mia a few weeks ago. Whereas a box of Land O’Lakes butter once featured Mia kneeling in a landscape of trees and water and holding up a package of the product, today’s has a similar landscape and the words “Farmer-Owned” and “Since 1921.” Other products will bear images of some of Land O’Lakes’ owner-producers.

The move drew little attention until the Minnesota Reformer wrote about the change, which prompted Beth Ford, the co-op’s president and chief executive, to issue a statement saying Land O’Lakes seeks with the change “to better connect the men and women who grow our food with those who consume it.”

Nowhere does Ford cite “political correctness” as a rationale for the change. Others, such as Minnesota Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan — a member of the White Earth Band of Ojibwe — applauded the move on that basis. Said Flanagan: “Native people are not mascots or logos.” And a North Dakota state legislator, Ruth Buffalo, said the outgoing logo sexualized Mia.

But Ford’s point about better connecting consumer to producer rings true. Land O’Lakes is a dairy behemoth, doing $14 billion in sales last year, but we daresay that most of its customers don’t know it’s a cooperative. Dropping a stereotype image from its packaging is a plus; better describing the business is added value."

The plan that Apple and Google have involves the use of Bluetooth LE, apps from public health authorities, and iOS and Android phones. Here is how this works. Those interested in participating will opt-in to the program and install certain apps from the appropriate app storefront. When Joe sits down near Lisa (maintaining social distancing of course), their phones will exchange identifying beacons. And every five minutes, people who walk near Joe and Lisa will have their identifying beacons stored in their phones as well So let's say that a few days later Joe tests positive for COVID-19. He then opens an app from a public health organization and enters the test result in that app. As long as Bob agrees, the people he was near for the past 14 days receive a notice that someone they were near has contracted the disease. This is all done on an anonymous basis and neither Apple nor Google will have access to the data.



 Yesterday, Republican Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri sent a letter (via AppleInsider ) to Tim Cook and Sundar Pichai, the CEOs of Apple and Google respectively. In the letter, Hawley said that the announcement of Apple and Google's plan ""raises serious concerns."" Among them is Google's poor reputation when it comes to privacy. For a senator, many of whom know zippo about technology (although they pretend to), Hawley's missive showed some understanding of what is involved in the two tech giant's plan.

Senator Hawley wrote, ""The possible implications this project could have for privacy are alarming. For example, your materials state that the data necessary for this project will be anonymized. But anonymity in data is notoriously unstable. Data typically can be reidentified simply by cross-referencing it with another data set. Pairing the data from this project with the GPS data that both your companies already collect could readily reveal individual identities. Worse, when paired with other data sets, the data from this project could create an extraordinarily precise mechanism for surveillance. Both your companies collect GPS data, but the GPS system has significant limits. It works poorly indoors and cannot pinpoint the floor a person is on. Combining the data from this project with GPS data (or other data, such as Wi-Fi positioning), could greatly erode privacy by making precise surveillance much easier.""

He goes on to say that Americans should be concerned that after the pandemic ends and there is no need for further contact tracing, Apple and Google won't change the interface to eliminate all of the privacy protections that both tech firms have included with the system. Hawley also worries that the apps that are developed for the contact tracing plan could also be used to obtain real-time location data. The senator sticks it to Google by stating, ""When it comes to sticking to promises, Google’s record is not exactly reassuring. Last year a Google representative had to admit, under oath, that Google still tracks location history even when a person turns location history off."" He then quotes an Associated Press report that says, ""Google wants to know where you go so badly that it records your movements even when you explicitly tell it not to.""

To make the public feel better about the contact tracing plan, Hawley asks both Cook and Pichai to make a commitment to be personally liable if they stop protecting the privacy of those who use the contact tracing system. As an example, the senator writes that they should personally agree to be held responsible if advertising companies are allowed to access the interface once the crisis comes to an end. He closes out his letter by noting that ""The public statements you make now can be enforced under federal and state consumer protection laws. Do not hide behind a corporate shield like so many privacy offenders have before. Stake your personal finances on the security of this project.""

Senator Hawley obviously seems concerned about Google pulling a fast one after the pandemic ends by turning the interface into a source of real-time location data for advertisers. He says to both Cook and Pichai that he looks forward to hearing how they plan on giving Americans assurance about their project. It should be interesting to see how the two executives reply."

Monty Brinton/CBS via Getty ImagesBack in November, Ariana Grande said that she loved the horror film Midsommar — so it’s no surprise that she’d be interested in owning one of the movie’s more iconic costumes.

A24, the production company responsible for Midsommar, as well as the movie Uncut Gems and the TV show Euphoria, is auctioning off props and costumes to raise money for COVID-19 relief efforts in New York City.

Among those costumes is the over-the-top May Queen dress, made of 10,000 silk flowers, worn by Florence Pugh in Midsommar. It goes up for auction on April 27 at noon ET with proceeds going to New York’s FDNY Foundation. On her Instagram Story, Ariana posted a screenshot of a text she received telling her about the auction, and her response, “THE AMOUNT OF PPL THAT HAVE TEXTED ME THIS.”

She also posted a message she wrote to Florence Pugh, saying, “i’m crying/ also I’m bidding as soon as possible.” To which Florence responded, “DO IT! Halloween will never be the same.” To which Ariana replied, “I WAS ALREADY PLANNING TO HAVE IT MADE ANYWAY BYE.”

Florence responded, “It even has hand holes for wine,” and Ariana replied, simply, “HELP ME.” She could have some competition, however: Halsey tweeted a GIF of Pugh in the movie crying, and wrote, “me, to myself: don’t bid for the midsommar may queen outfit dont bid for the midsommar may queen outfit…”

And speaking of charity auctions, Ariana has joined the A-list celebrity All In Challenge auction. She’s offering fans the chance to win a studio hangout with her, followed by dinner, with all proceeds going to Feeding America, Meals on Wheels, World Central Kitchen and No Kid Hungry.

45,45,https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/unhcr-flash-legislative-update-response-covid-19-outbreak-ukraine-and-its-impact,UNHCR flash legislative update on response to COVID-19 outbreak in Ukraine and its impact on UNCHR’s operation in Ukraine (21 April 2020) - Ukraine,"English News and Press Release on Ukraine about Health, Protection and Human Rights, IDPs and Epidemic; published on 21 Apr 2020 by UNHCR",reliefweb.int,"In mid-April, the Parliament adopted additional measures related to the response to the COVID-19 outbreak in Ukraine, while the Government continues to promulgate its Resolutions of 8 April. This update provides information on the new measures adopted and needs to be read in conjunction with the flash updates issued earlier.

The Resolution #266 1 strengthens the protection of social rights of IDPs through specifying the provision of social benefits to IDPs during the quarantine period:
• None In case the 6 months’ term for the payment of the IDP targeted assistance expires during the quarantine period or during the 30 days that will follow the end of that period, it will be automatically prolonged for another 6 months.

 This means that IDPs will not have to come or in any other way apply to a social protection department for the prolongation of their targeted assistance. The same is applicable to all social benefits2 to which IDPs are entitled;
• None Residence in NGCA or Crimea during the quarantine period or during the 30 days following the end of the quarantine measures will not be counted towards the 60 days’ term allowed for staying in territories outside Governmental control. Therefore, persons who remain in these territories will not be deprived of their IDP targeted assistance, of other social benefits and pensions during that period. The payments will be automatically allocated on their bank accounts without the verification that should have been conducted by “Oshchadbank” in a regular situation;
• None The IDP certificates will not be revoked during the quarantine period or during the 30 days following the end of the quarantine measures. In a regular situation, in case an IDP is absent at the controlled part of the territory for 60 days or more, his/her IDP registration is cancelled and the IDP certificate is revoked.

This initiative is a positive step towards the implementation of the Law 530-IX adopted on 17 March 2020, which introduced the automatic prolongation of all social benefits for IDPs during the quarantine measures adopted by the Government and for 30 days after they are lifted. It is of extreme importance to disseminate this information among IDPs and conflict-affected population and monitor how these rules are implemented.

The Law #555-IX3 introduces a set of basic definitions related to staying in observation and specifies the exchange of information related to potential cases of COVID-19 infection in Ukraine:
• The law defines “self-isolation”, “observation site” and “observation”. The main difference between self-isolation and observation resides in the level of restrictions in the two regimes: self-isolated persons can decide for themselves where to undergo isolation measures while, when in observation, a person is placed in an identified facility. The self-isolation regime applies to those with regards to whom there are “reasonable grounds” (not specified) to believe that a person is infected or belongs to the risk group of persons who could be severely affected if infected. The observation regime applies to those who can create a risk of spreading the infection (e.g. already tested positive but are experiencing mild symptoms), who require medical check and treatment.

The functions of the local authorities to specify the grounds for self-isolation or observation in local emergency situations are not clear;
• None A “territory under quarantine” (to be defined by local authorities) is completed by “other administrative and territorial units within it”. This may allow for an application of lighter or more restrictive quarantine measures to one or several settlements/areas/parts of cities;
• None The Ministry of Health should define how to equip and to ensure the proper functioning of identified observation sites;
• None If a person wants to leave territory under quarantine before the quarantine measures are lifted, (s)he should receive a special certificate allowing him/her to leave the quarantined zone during the incubation period (14 days). The Ministry of Health should elaborate a template for such certificates. It is not totally clear who and how one would assess whether the health status of a person would justify the possibility to leave the quarantined territory. Moreover, the “quarantined zone” is not defined;
• None Persons in self-isolation/observation will receive sick leave notes and will have access to the respective social benefits for persons temporarily not able to work after a disease (which is relevant only for those who are officially employed);
• None The Government’s decision to apply quarantine measures may define a special procedure to record such situations as well as to regulate the exchange of information on medical cases during the quarantine period. It is not totally clear how this rule will be implemented. It may be done through special application for tracking COVID-19 cases described in the Government Resolution #255 or by other measures. The details might be specified in a subsequent Government Resolution;
• None Threat to personal data protection: Transitional provisions allow personal data processing without agreement of the persons concerned with regard to health status, place of self-isolation/hospitalization, surname, name, patronymic, date of birth, place of residence, work/study place. This means that personal data of anyone in self-isolation may be collected and exchanged among different state authorities without the consent of the person or without the person being aware that his/her personal data is shared among the authorities. The only safeguard is in the statement that the data shall be used only for “reasons related to the quarantine measures”. These data should be depersonalized or deleted during 30 days after the quarantine measures are lifted. The processing of these data is not clearly specified. It may be assumed that it will happen through a new e-application for tracking COVID-19 cases, but its operational scope is not properly tested. In addition to this, personal data may be processed through other channels which are not specified."

Why you should pay them immediately,"Yes, Uncle Sam gave you more time to pay those 2019 taxes and submit last year's returns. However, there's no reprieve for people who owe from 2018 and 2017 -- and those sums are accruing interest.",www.cnbc.com,"The IRS isn't processing paper returns right now as they deal with distributing coronavirus stimulus checks. While that's not an issue for most taxpayers, who currently have until July 15 to turn in their 2019 federal income tax returns and pay any amounts owed, it is a big problem for people who have to file amended returns. These can only be processed on paper. The solution: if you owe something for prior years, pay it now as penalties and interest continue to pile up.

""I envision the paper returns in a mailroom somewhere in a big stack,"" said April Walker, CPA and lead manager for tax practice and ethics at the American Institute of CPAs. ""The IRS has also said that if you filed the paper return for whatever reason, be it current or amended, don't file another one and don't ask about the status because they won't know,"" she said. Here's a surprise: Just because the IRS won't process your amended return from 2018 or 2017, it doesn't mean you get a break on the liability you may still owe from that year. ""If you have an amended return and you know you owe money but can only file on paper, then the interest is definitely accruing from the time the amended return was due,"" said Walker.

In addition to interest accruing on your balance owed, you could also be subject to a failure-to-pay penalty – 0.5% of the tax owed for each month or part of a month the tax remains unpaid, up to 25%. If you're late submitting your return, you're also subject to a failure-to-file penalty. That adds up to 5% of the unpaid tax for each month or part of a month that your return is late. Forget cutting a check at this point. Make a direct payment to the IRS electronically. More from Smart Tax Planning:

Alternatively, if the amount you owe is so large that you can't pay it in one fell swoop, you can enter an installment agreement with the IRS online. This way, you'll chip away at the balance owed every month. If you have an amended return and you found out you're owed a refund from a prior year, congratulations!

(AP) -- With legions out of work, Republicans across the critical battleground states are trying to lay blame for the economic wreckage of",mynorthwest.com,"HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — With legions out of work, Republicans across the critical battleground states are trying to lay blame for the economic wreckage of the coronavirus outbreak on Democratic governors, ramping up a political strategy that is likely to shape the debate in the run-up to the presidential election.

In Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania — all three swing states with Democrats in charge — state Republican lawmakers, after an initial detente, have grown fiercely critical of the stay-at-home orders or business shutdowns imposed by governors to limit the spread of the coronavirus, casting them as the work of overzealous, nanny-state Democrats.

In Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, GOP legislators have gone so far as to try to strip the Democratic governors of the power to enforce the restrictions on businesses.

Stay-at-home orders have been imposed by Republican and Democratic governors alike, acting on the advice of state and federal health officials and guidance from President Donald Trump.

But the backlash comes as some governors, mostly Republicans, are beginning to ease their orders, and the GOP, led by Trump, is attempting to position itself as the defender of the economy, even if it means taking health risks.

“We’re going to pressure this governor. We’re going to get you guys your jobs. We’re going to get money back in your pocket!” Republican state Rep. Aaron Bernstine of Pennsylvania told a protest of hundreds of people Monday at the state Capitol. It was one of several staged across the country in the past two weeks, and another is scheduled for Friday in Wisconsin’s capital.

In Pennsylvania, Republican state Rep. Russ Diamond blasted Gov. Tom Wolf’s “lockdown,” while GOP state Sen. Doug Mastriano urged protesters to “rise up” and “say ‘no’ to tyranny.”

The hard-line messages marked the arrival of a more contentious phase in the virus fallout — the political fight over who to blame for the economic devastation. Implicit in the messaging is the potential political disaster ahead for Republicans if jobs do not return by November and Trump is blamed for unemployment.

Between Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, all of which narrowly flipped to Republican in the 2016 presidential election and handed Trump his victory, more than 3 million people have filed for unemployment benefits, and economists expect that high unemployment will last well beyond November’s election.

Before the virus hit, Trump and his party had planned on running on a strong economy. The new reality forces Republicans on the ballot to adjust.

But the effort to target Democratic governors has challenges. Right now, stay-at-home orders are broadly popular with both Democrats and Republicans, according to a new AP-NORC survey. And Americans have generally given higher marks to their state government’s response than to the federal response. Meanwhile, Trump’s approval rating has been stagnant.

“Some politicians who started off this crisis with more goodwill and higher ratings might be able to (avoid blame), but I don’t see where the president can do that,” said Christopher Nicholas, a Pennsylvania-based Republican campaign strategist.

But polling does find some growing impatience with the virus restrictions, particularly among Republicans. In late March, 60% of Republicans living in states led by Democratic governors approved of their state’s response. But the new AP-NORC poll found that share had slipped to 49% in just three weeks.

In the interim, Trump appeared to have shifted his focus from managing the public health crisis to looking ahead to “reopening” the economy. Governors have broad authority to impose and lift the stay-at-home orders that closed businesses, parks and schools. The White House has issued guidance on the public health conditions that should be met before those orders are eased, but Trump has called on some of his supporters to “LIBERATE!” their states.

Many in his party took the cue.

In Pennsylvania, Republicans have complained about the breadth of the shutdown and launched a flurry of bills designed to limit Wolf’s broad authority.

In Wisconsin, Republicans who control the Legislature asked the state Supreme Court to block Gov. Tony Evers from extending a stay-at-home order through May 26.

In their lawsuit, Republican Assembly Speaker Robin Vos and Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald argued that the Department of Health Services secretary exceeded her authority by exercising “czar-like powers” that, if left in place, will devastate the economy and leave Wisconsin “in shambles.”

Evers predicted more deaths if the Legislature wins the case.

“People die every day because of this, and the more we screw around with it, the more people die,” Evers said.

In Michigan — home to the third-most reported deaths related to COVID-19 in the country — Republicans have ramped up their criticism of Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. Her order is an outlier, they say, and they want it amended to allow lawn care services, garden centers, construction projects and other business activity.

Like other governors, Wolf, Whitmer and Evers say they cannot significantly ease restrictions until they expand testing and keep those infected out of the workplace. They, along with some Republican governors, say they don’t yet have sufficient testing supplies from the federal government.

Brock McCleary, a Pennsylvania-based Republican pollster, said governors seem to have the advantage right now in public approval.

But, he said, perspectives could change, and Trump and Republicans could benefit if voters look back at the shutdowns and say, “Gee, not that many people died. Was it all worth it?'”

During Monday’s protest at Pennsylvania’s Capitol, Republican state Sen. Judy Ward was booed when she told the crowd that it “frightens” her that so many people were standing shoulder-to-shoulder without face masks.

She also urged Wolf to reopen the state in a “graduated way” and told the crowd to be mindful of what scientists say.

Then she railed against the shutdown.

“Do we need the government to mandate that certain businesses close? No! Do we need the government to choose winners and losers? No! Do we need the government to mandate that we must wear a face mask?” she shouted.

Speaking to radio DZMM, Villar said among their priorities is the safety of construction workers.

“Hindi na puwede ang dati. Baka kailangan na ng social distancing, testing at handwashing facilities,” he said.

The DWPH will seek the approval of health authorities and the Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID) before it resumes construction work which was stalled by the coronavirus-induced lockdown.

“Ipapakita sa grupo na ang gagawing protocol is safe… para at least maging kampante ang health officials na safe ang ating site... safe ang ating mga trabahador,” Villar said.

Construction of major infrastructure projects has been suspended since March, affecting around a million construction workers, mainly in Luzon, he added.
• DPWH says on track to meet 'Build, Build, Build' targets for 2020 despite lockdown

He also said the agency will conduct mass testing among its employees after 4 of them have died due to COVID-19.

Around P30 billion from the Duterte administration's “Build, Build, Build” infrastructure program was reallocated to critical areas to help the government address the crisis.

The Office for National Statistics said on Thursday that borrowing between April last year and March this year stood at 48.7 billion pounds, compared with the most recent estimate of 47.4 billion pounds by the country’s budget forecasters.

That was 9.3 billion pounds higher than in the 2018/19 financial year and equivalent to 2.2% of gross domestic product.

The Office for Budget Responsibility, which produces Britain’s official economic forecasts, last week said the budget deficit could surge to 14% of GDP in the 2020/21 financial year due to the coronavirus shutdown.

“The full effects of COVID-19 on the public finances will become clearer in the coming months,” the ONS said as it published Thursday’s data.

“This means that some of the statistics included in this release will be prone to larger revisions than normal, once more data become available.”

In March alone, the deficit - excluding state-controlled banks - stood at 3.05 billion pounds, higher than a median forecast in a Reuters poll for a 2.35 billion-pound shortfall.

Value-added tax receipts fell, reflecting the government’s decision to allow companies to defer VAT payments as the crisis escalated and less spending by households.

The ONS also said the figures did not yet show additional healthcare spending."
53,53,http://theshillongtimes.com/2020/04/23/patients-privacy-versus-public-security/,Patients’ privacy versus public security,,theshillongtimes.com,"These few days have been really tough for our state, especially for our government leaders, health workers, the Police Department, the CRPF personnel and the citizenry due to the pandemic. Besides worrying about when the shops would open so one can purchase few kilograms of rice, I became all the more restless these days, thinking whether I have come in contact with X or Y prior to March 24 or even later before the first Covid+ive case was tested. While, I appreciate the Chief Minister for his daily briefings about the Covid-19 cases in our State, I personally feel he is not doing justice to the citizens and to halt the Covid19 spread. For example, his Twitter account on April 21 reads, “One Family friend of the first Covid19 patient has also been tested positive. The person is already in quarantine. The total number is at 12. One deceased and other 11 are stable.” Good news! Every one of the 11 is stable, but how do I know that I have not come in contact with any one of those who tested positive? Who is the person who tested positive? Did my friend met her/him? Did she/he come to my locality? Was she/he the one with whom I sat in a vehicle prior to the lockdown? I am more worried of the unknown positive carrier. I know it is against medical ethics and patients’ privacy to reveal the name, but for Covid19 which is so contagious can there be an exception to the rule so that at least those who came in contact with the positive person can also be tested?

One reason cited by professionals about not revealing the name of the patient is to avoid stigmatization especially on social media. If this is the case what are those in the cyber crime branch of the Police doing? There is nothing that can be hidden on social media provided we know coding. I believe those who are appointed as cyber crime detectors are professionals in that job, then why not catch the culprit and give necessary punishments? But for the sake of the patient’s secrecy we cannot put the whole state and the public at risk and I think for a case such as covid19, the more we know who is tested positive the better we can co-operate with the government and come out for testing. Besides, Covid19 is an issue impacting everyone; hence everyone has the right to know so that the chain of infection can be broken. I also urge the patients to be prudent in this regard and the public to respect them by not maligning them.

Views and opinions have already appeared in the media about the dreaded covid-19 pandemic which has taken many precious lives across the globe, India included. The virus continues to claim thousands of human lives every day even as research scientists are struggling to find the right vaccine to prevent and cure the deadly virus. In Meghalaya the virus first appeared on April 13, 2020 and claimed its first victim the next day. By the time the victim was buried another 12 people were found Covid- positive. The virus seems to be very active but God forbid it will not become virulent here as Meghalaya’s population is small. During the last 31 days of the lockdown Meghalaya’s economy has overstretched its limits and affected the supply chain. Again God forbid the number of patients will not increase and also the number of deaths because with just 12 positive cases and one death the whole government machinery is at it wits end.

Where to test and quarantine those suspected of being infected and how to treat the positive cases, because as of now the infrastructure is limited, are causes for worry. Even disposal of just one dead body was a nightmare! Hence, it is of utmost importance to immediately put in place a Covid-19 high powered committee to look into the whole gamut of planning, supervising, procurement, delivery, supply systems, disposal etc. Again, on the disposal of dead bodies there are still some issues to be ironed out because as can be sensed, there will be opposition from some quarters. Intensive awareness on Covid19 is required not only in towns but in villages as well because we do not know how things will pan out.

Even in other parts of India disposal of bodies of those who died of covid-19 was met with stiff resistance. On the part of the general public of Meghalaya it is our bounden duty to cooperate with the government and strictly adhere to the covid-19 health protocols. With regards to the Dorbar Shong their roles cannot be underestimated. Sadly the government remembers them only during crisis such as this and during law and order problems. Enabling legislation is urgently called for to legally empower them to be partners in village levels of administration and government because the Dorbar Shnong are here to stay, whether or not we want them.

We must appreciate Michael Syiem’s letter to the Shillong Times (April 22, 2020) titled Covid 19 in Meghalaya. Questioning, analysing and debating the issues of the day is in public interest. This discourse must be free of emotion and bias, as his letter demonstrates. Unfortunately, many of the details are not known or divulged, so we can only base our discussion on the information in the public domain, depending mostly on government communiques and credible news sources.

Dr Sailo’s illness seems to have taken a sudden turn for the worse and he succumbed unfortunately within 2-3 days of the onset of symptoms. When he had the early symptoms of the disease, he may not have associated them with Covid, even though he is a medical doctor. The early symptoms are non-specific, explainable by many infections and allergies. One is only expected to have a high index of suspicion, if he/she has been in contact with a known positive case. This was not the situation.

Even if he was worried about Covid, he would not have qualified for testing under the then ICMR guidelines which mandated testing only for high-risk contacts of a known case, or people with flu-like symptoms located in clusters and migration centres. At that time, there was not a single case in Meghalaya. Another criterion is testing all patients with pneumonia. It looks like his test was done on this basis, which for him was in the last stage of treatment.

It is now presumed, even though there is an unwarranted silence from the Government, that the pilot in the family is negative for the virus (RT-PCR test). If a blood test is done on him for antibodies and it is positive, it will indicate that he had the infection earlier. The negative RT-PCR test combined with the positive antibody test indicates that he was probably no longer infective when he came to Shillong. He also presumably was in self-isolation as required and was checked on as per the quarantine protocol.

Dr Sailo may have got infected from a patient who was asymptomatic for Covid and met the doctor for another ailment. It may not have been from a family member, they all got it from him. Even if these assumptions are wrong, it does not matter much. Identifying the first case, i.e. the one who gave the virus to Dr Sailo, is not that important. The public health measures remain the same.

It seems to me that there was no intentional or unintentional wrongdoing by the family."

Trump has not mentioned hydroxychloroquine at his coronavirus news briefings since last Tuesday, according to Politico. The president was asked about a study which found more deaths among COVID-19 patients at Veterans Health Administration medical centers who took the drug than those who did not on Tuesday. The study, which has not yet been peer-reviewed and was not a “rigorous experiment,” found that 28% of patients who received the drug and routine care died, compared to 11% who died after only receiving routine care.

“I don’t know of the report,” Trump said at Tuesday’s briefing. “Obviously, there’ve been some very good reports, and perhaps this one’s not a good report. But be looking at it, we’ll have a comment on it . . . I’m always willing to take a look.”

Trump previously touted a small French study which claimed to have a 100% success rate in treating coronavirus patients with the drug. The study has since been discredited by its publisher after it was discovered that researchers removed several patients who died or were moved into an intensive care unit from their results.

CNN host Don Lemon criticized Trump for shrugging off the potentially fatal side effects of a drug he has promoted for weeks.

“Now the president just says that he’s going to take a look. That’s not good enough. He’s got a responsibility to take this seriously,” Lemon said. “He promoted a totally unproven drug again and again, telling Americans desperate to do something, anything to save their lives, what have you got to lose, he said. Now he’s doing the ‘I barely know the guy’ routine with the drug that he said would be the game-changer and a gift from heaven.”

Fox News, which turned Trump on to the drug in the first place, has also backed off the hype by a lot. The network’s hosts mentioned the drug at least 194 times in the first week of April and 138 times in the second week of April. But mentions of the drug declined to just 51 times for the week of April 15, The Daily Beast reported.

Primetime host Laura Ingraham frequently touted the drug on her show but “barely mentioned it last week and has done so only once since last Wednesday,” according to the report. Host Tucker Carlson, who first brought the drug to Trump’s attention, “has only mentioned the drug once in passing over the past 10 days.” Host Sean Hannity, who repeatedly pushed the drug, has not mentioned it in nearly a week.

Dr. Mehmet Oz, who has regularly promoted the drug on Fox News, urged viewers Wednesday to wait until clinical trials have been completed before rushing to judgment.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently removed guidelines for doctors using the drug to treat coronavirus patients.

A panel convened by the National Institutes of Health issued new guidelines Tuesday warning doctors against using hydroxychloroquine, especially in combination with the antibiotic azithromycin, which the president has pushed.

The panel warned that the combination was associated with an increased risk of sudden cardiac death, plus additional side effects.

“There are insufficient clinical data to recommend either for or against using chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19,” the panel said. “If chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine is used, clinicians should monitor the patient for adverse effects.”

“Will anyone who breathlessly pitched hydroxychloroquine as a miracle drug show a modicum of regret or even self-awareness over this?” The Daily Beast’s Sam Stein asked on Twitter. “Doubtful.”"
56,56,https://www.varsity.co.uk/news/19080,Cambridge Living Wage Campaign issues demand for worker safety and pay transparency,,www.varsity.co.uk,"The Cambridge Living Wage Campaign (CLWC) has today issued a statement calling on colleges to display a higher degree of transparency around worker safety and compensation during the coronavirus lockdown.

CLWC have demanded that colleges “take a more responsible approach to their employees during the quarantine period” amid claims that “multiple colleges” are “bringing what the campaign considers non-essential staff into colleges during a period where they could endanger their own lives, the lives of their families, and those of students still living in university accommodation”.

A press release from the group emphasised the importance of transparency in allowing workers to “know whether they’re being protected by their employers”. CLWC also described transparency as “critical in enabling students to stand in solidarity with workers”.

The Cambridge University Students Union (CUSU) led campaign states that it has “attempted to reach out to colleges for clear guidance on their definitions of essential workers”, whilst also inquiring if the personal protective equipment (PPE) provided to those still working within colleges is “adequate to protect workers against the virus”.

CLWC’s statement comes at a time of increased scrutiny of the government’s provision of PPE for those working in the health and care sectors.

The campaign group said it is essential for colleges to “prioritise the safety and well-being of their staff, students and fellows above all else” by providing essential workers with PPE when likely to be coming into contact with people potentially having or confirmed to have the virus.

They also called on the University and colleges to ensure workers on visas, who would normally be subject to NHS surcharge fees, are made aware that COVID-19 treatment and testing is free from these charges.

With regards to college staff who are not presently working, the CLWC claims eight colleges are yet to provide “students with any response on their [coronavirus employment] policy”, while others “have not indicated whether casual staff have been furloughed”.

Varsity has approached the colleges mentioned by CLWC for comment.

CLWC state they are in the process of gathering information from Jesus College. Some colleges have complained that they have not been given adequate time to respond to the questions or that they have not received any contact from CLWC.

Where colleges have described furloughing staff, CWLC state “it is often unclear why this has only been limited to some workers considering all are eligible under the government scheme”.

CLWC’s second set of demands, in light of this newly gathered information, revolves around pay; protecting the pay of workers, utilising the Job Retention Scheme where appropriate and requiring no employees will be made redundant during the pandemic or as a consequence of the pandemic.

The Job Retention Scheme, introduced by the Chancellor on March 22nd, ensures the government will pay 80% of the salary for workers who are kept on by their employer.

CLWC asks colleges to provide the additional 20% of staff’s normal wages which are not covered by the Job Retention Scheme. They deem this necessary as some workers may not be able to afford basic necessities without the supplementary 20%.

While some colleges, including Queens’ and Pembroke said they would top up wages for casual staff being furloughed, CWLC claimed that others had been less clear in their responses, suggesting this indicated “they will not top up the 80% of wages for casual staff that they are claiming from the Job Retention Scheme”

A representative from Darwin College responded to a request for comment in stating that the College's position had not been ""accurately reported"" in the release, adding that the College's current approach is ""that we will pay those casuals employed by the College in full based on the government's calculations"".

For these workers, they added that ""the College will bear the cost of the difference (the 20%) not reimbursed under the government scheme. The College's student-run bar have taken their own different decision on this.""

Trinity Hall stated that it had ""no comment"" on the press release.

CLWC stressed that these demands related to pay should also cover outsourced workers. If these conditions are not guaranteed for outsourced employees, CWLC believes the University and colleges should take action.

Reaffirming a call for transparency, CWLC stated that “although some colleges have been open and clear about their policies on protecting workers against financial insecurity and threats to their health in the COVID-19 lockdown, far too many have only given partial information or none at all.”

In a statement CUSU said, “It is unacceptable that many colleges are failing to cover 100% of staff wages during this difficult period. Wages for non-academic staff are already disgracefully low, and failing to maintain them risks putting college workers into increasingly precarious positions.”

They added that CUSU is “fully behind students and unions working to hold colleges to account over these important issues.”

Updated Friday 11.14am: This article was updated to remove allegations made by CLWC where right of reply had not been offered prior to publication. Varsity apologises for the initial publication of these claims.

The program was created to make it easier for neighbors to help each other get needed essentials during the COVID-19 pandemic.",www.wral.com,"Walmart and Nextdoor have come together to offer a new

The program was created to make it easier for neighbors to help each other get needed essentials during the COVID-19 pandemic. Nextdoor members will now be able to request assistance or offer to help someone in their community by coordinating the pickup and delivery of their groceries, medications and other essentials with a neighbor who is already planning a shopping trip to their local Walmart store.

This service is launching on April 23, 2020 and is available to everyone in the U.S. All Walmart store locations – more than 4,700 stores – can be shopped as a part of this program and Nextdoor is where people can connect with a “helper” or a “helpee.”

The new initiative follows recent moves by Walmart to make other shopping services, like checking out with Walmart Pay and its curbside pickup and delivery services, contact-free.

“I’ve seen first-hand the countless ways our Walmart team is working together during this challenging time, leading with humanity, compassion and understanding to serve our customers,” said Janey Whiteside, Walmart’s Chief Customer Officer. “We’re continuing to do that through our new program with Nextdoor. We’re connecting neighbors to each other so that more members of our communities have access to essential items, while limiting contact and the number of people shopping in our stores.”

Following are the details on how the program works from their press release.

* If a Nextdoor member would like help shopping for needed items or wants to offer their help to do so, they just visit or log on to the Nextdoor app, which is available on both iOS and Android phones.

* From there, members click on the “Groups” tab and will see Walmart stores in their area pinned to the top of the page.

* Members will then be prompted to share a message in the group feed where they can indicate if they need help or want to help.

* Once members connect in the feed they can work out details of the shopping trip on the message board or direct message each other to work on the specifics. Neighbors are encouraged to utilize contact-free payment options and delivery methods.

“We’re inspired everyday by the kindness of people around the world who are stepping up and helping out. In recent weeks, we’ve been blown away by the number of members who have raised their hand to run an errand, go to the grocery store, or pick up a prescription for a neighbor,” said Sarah Friar, Nextdoor CEO. “We’re grateful for Walmart's partnership to make this important connection between neighbors around vital services, and we’re proud to come together to ensure everyone has a neighborhood to rely on.”

The “Neighbors Helping Neighbors” program builds on Nextdoor’s recently launched “Groups” feature which enables members to organize around a shared interest or project. Over the last few weeks, Nextdoor has seen a 7x increase in people joining groups to help one another – from checking in with the elderly and vulnerable to running errands for those who simply need a helping hand.

Sabrewing’s aircraft roll-out ceremony will be shown live online at 1 PM Pacific Daylight time, Friday, May 1, 2020 and will be carried as the final event of the Agility Prime kick-off. For more information and to attend online, please visit https://agilityprime.com.

Sabrewing is the first company to win a contract under the Air Force’s Agility Prime program under an AFWERX Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase II contract. The contract, valued at $3.25 million, will test Sabrewing’s prototype aircraft and equipment in a variety of different ways.

""We are going to accelerate this market for domestic use in a way that also helps our military,” stated Dr. Will Roper, Assistant Secretary of the Air Force For Acquisition, Technology and Logistics. ""The Air Force is all in,” Roper stressed. Roper went on to say that the size of any future Air Force vehicle purchases would depend on the missions that eVTOL vehicles prove capable of carrying out. “If it’s helping us to do logistics at the edge, we could end up buying these in higher quantities,” Roper said.

Sabrewing’s production aircraft - the ""Rhaegal-B” - is an eVTOL (electric vertical and takeoff and landing) aircraft, capable of carrying a Unit Load Devices (ULD) - the same type of cargo containers used by airlines and air cargo carriers. The Rhaegal can either carry two LD-1 containers, or four LD-2 containers, or two LD-3 containers. The eVTOL can take off and land like a helicopter as well as take off and land like a conventional aircraft. The “Rhaegal-B has a capacity of a 5,400 pounds (2,450 kg) of payload to and from locations without any runway, bringing tons of cargo to the remotest parts of the world. It has a range of 1000 nautical miles at altitudes of 22,000 feet (6,700 meters) at speeds of up to 200 knots (370 kph). In addition, the Rhaegal can fly like a conventional aircraft, taking off from one airport and landing at another with a payload of over 10,000 pounds (4,500 kg). The aircraft uses electric motors to turn fans within ducts that provide lift during takeoff and landing, but uses a main wing to provide lift during cruise flight.

“After several years of market research and speaking with dozens of cargo carriers, we gain an understanding/knowledge of what was needed in a cargo aircraft,” said Ed De Reyes, CEO of Sabrewing Aircraft Company. Sabrewing designed and built a VTOL cargo UAV that was not only the top of its class for drones, it topped the class of manned aircraft as well. “Our cargo UAV can take off and land like a helicopter with a heavy payload, as well as fly farther, faster and higher at a fraction of the cost of any other aircraft in its class,” he added.

The Agility Prime evaluation of Sabrewing’s aircraft includes the aircraft’s Detect And Avoid system (DAA), as well as testing to determine if the aircraft can operate in an environment where accurate GPS signals are jammed or unavailable. In addition, the evaluation included simulating payloads, locations and evaluations of the performance of the aircraft – including casualty evacuation (CASEVAC) demonstrations with simulated casualties.

According to Air Force Col. Nathan Diller, Integrated Product Team Lead for the Agility Prime program, the contract with Sabrewing for demonstrations and development of aspects of the Rhaegal aircraft is in accordance with the principles of the Agility Prime program. ""The intent of the initiative is to help develop the industrial base through market stimulation in an effort to accelerate commercial and military fielding. This creates additional capability for our operators while saving the taxpayer money,” he added.

The FCO said 3,600 more stranded travellers will be able to return home from India as a result of the new charters scheduled between April 28 and May 4.

Once completed, these additional flights will bring the total number of people flown to the UK from India on 52 UK government charter flights to over 13,000.

'Travel to and from India is severely restricted and so we have organised a series of charter flights. Through these 52 UK charter flights, we will have brought back 13,000 people and our staff in India will continue to support all those UK nationals who need our help,' said UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, the minister who finalised the GBP 75-million repatriation scheme for stranded Britons around the world.

FCO Minister of State for South Asia and the Commonwealth Lord Tariq Ahmad has been coordinating the exercise with his Indian counterparts and respective state chief ministers to help put the logistics in place for the flights.

'We have already helped over 6,500 people return from India since we began our charter flight programme, with a further 7,000 due to return in the coming weeks. The 14 new flights announced today bring the total number of UK government charter flights from India to 52,' said Ahmad.

'We are continuing to work around the clock to ensure all British travellers in India are supported to come back to the UK if they wish,' he said.

Jan Thompson, Acting High Commissioner to India, added: 'We are extremely grateful for the close and continuing support of the Indian government and airport authorities in facilitating this unprecedented repatriation exercise.

'We are continuing to work around the clock to get as many British nationals home as possible.' Since the coronavirus outbreak began, the FCO says it has worked consistently with governments, air carriers and travel companies to minimise disruption and help British travellers return home safely -- supported with GBP 75 million for special charter flights to priority countries, focused on helping the most vulnerable people.

More than 13,200 people have already returned to the UK on 63 flights organised by the FCO from 18 different countries and territories, including over 700 from Pakistan, over 1,700 from South Africa and over 1,200 from Peru.

The charter flights are for British nationals who normally reside in the UK and their direct dependents.

Details regarding flights, luggage allowance and costs are available on the FCO's India Travel Advice page.

Seats on the flights are only available to those already registered and on a waitlist.

Those who are eligible to fly will be sent information on how to get to airports and flight itineraries directly when their seat is confirmed. PTI AK IND IND"

According to the hospital’s latest report, 134 out of 186 COVID-19 patients, who have been admitted to the hospital since February 3, have been discharged as of Wednesday.

Meanwhile, 33 or up to 16 percent of the patients died while receiving treatment in the hospital.

PGH spokesman Jonas Del Rosario told DZBB in an interview Wednesday that those patients were suffering from severe or critical symptoms of COVID-19.

“‘Yung mga pasyente po na nakukuha namin sa PGH ay ‘yun pong medyo advanced ‘yung sakit. May mga mild din po, pero mas marami ‘yung moderate to critical to severe na po for COVID,” he said.

Del Rosario said that the PGH has already regulated the number of admitted patients as the 130-capacity-hospital have been catering to around 150 patients for the past few days.

The hospital’s latest report showed that there are only 136 confirmed, suspect, and probable COVID-19 patients currently admitted at the PGH.

The PGH spokesman said they had to open the pay wing where the admitted patients haave to pay for the expenses not covered by the Philippine Health Insurance Corp. (PhilHealth).

Aside from the limited bed capacity, Del Rosario said they had to be careful not to exhaust their 900 COVID-19-dedicated staff.

The PGH is serving as a COVID-19 referral center, per the Department of Health’s (DoH) request, to limit the exhaustion of staff and equipment in all hospitals nationwide.

Del Rosario said that as of Wednesday, 17 COVID-19 patients who have recovered from the disease have donated their blood plasma to PGH to help other patients.

Senators Miguel Zubiri and Sonny Angara were among the COVID-19 survivors who donated their blood plasma for the hospital’s convalescent plasma therapy program.

Five adults and one child admitted at PGH received some of the blood plasma donations, the PGH spokesman said.

Earlier, Del Rosario said the blood of the recovered COVID-19 patients are rich with antibodies that could help fight the disease.

COVID-19 survivors who wish to donate their blood plasma may reach the hospital at 155-200. (Minka Tiangco)"

71,71,https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20200424-coronavirus-gaza-copes-efficiently-despite-severe-resources-shortage/,Coronavirus: Gaza copes efficiently despite severe resources shortage,,www.middleeastmonitor.com,"As of 23 April, the number of coronavirus cases around the world has reached 2,699,462 and the number of deaths has peaked at 188,930. The numbers are still multiplying in many countries, posing grave challenges ahead of many countries, including the most developed, with the best medical equipment and economic resources.

There is no need to cite examples of what these countries are doing and the extent of the suffering they are enduring. This article concerns one of the most densely populated areas on earth – the Gaza Strip. It is likely the 40th most densely populated urban area, globally. This article will discuss how it has been dealing successfully with protecting itself from the coronavirus.

Under the Israeli occupation, the Gaza Strip is considered the largest open-air prison in the world. Since 2006, the Gaza Strip has been enduring a strict air, sea and ground siege imposed by Israel and Egypt, and backed by the international community, mainly the Western powers and the US. This coastal enclave has undergone several Israeli offensives, including three major ones during the time of the siege.

The strict Israeli siege, along with the Israeli offensives, caused serious damage in all infrastructures in Gaza, mainly the medical sector, which has been suffering from a severe shortage of medical equipment and medicine, and many of its facilities are in urgent need of renovation in order to be fit for offering basic healthcare services.

READ: Will the Coronavirus Change the World? On Gramsci’s ‘Interregnum’ and Zizek’s Ethnocentric Philosophy

The Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza has launched an urgent appeal worth $23 million and has announced that it needs to increase the free ICU beds from 74 to 100, as well as to increase its respirators from 70 to 100, pointing out this is the least required facilities that would help it cope with a possible coronavirus outbreak.

However, the Israeli occupation has always warned that if the Gaza Strip was hit with the coronavirus, it would also be affected. Therefore, Israeli officials have claimed that the Israeli occupation authorities permitted the required equipment to reach Gaza – but that has never been the truth. Just two days ago, the Israeli Hebrew newspaper Maariv revealed that the Israel defence minister had stopped carrying out coronavirus tests, which had been carried out for only two days before it was stopped, and was done without the knowledge of the political leadership.

Under these circumstances, which reflect a bleak situation in the Gaza Strip, Gazan rulers are showing a wise and astute governance in relation to the coronavirus situation. They have been successful in their leadership for several reasons as outlined:

Firstly, the strict protective measures imposed on the Gazan residents, mainly with those who were abroad and have returned home. The government in Gaza, which is run by Hamas, immediately prepared quarantine centres for thousands of people and did not make room for any exceptions, even for senior Hamas leaders. A senior delegation of Palestinian factions appealed to the Hamas leader in Gaza, Yahya Al-Sinwar, in order to return home after an international tour, but he refused and told them to follow the example of Hamas senior leaders in quarantine.

Hamas believes that the only successful means to win the battle against the coronavirus is to follow strict pre-emptive measures, so is dealing with this issue stringently.

Secondly, the government in Gaza transformed several schools into very well-equipped quarantine centres with hundreds of beds. Several hotel owners donated their hotels to the Ministry of Health to temporarily use as quarantine centres, however, all the rooms in schools and hotels became quickly occupied. The government stopped the entry of the returnees from abroad until it had received a newly built and equipped quarantine centre with 1,000 beds each in a separate room with a separate toilet and hygiene kits, in addition to several other schools which were also prepared to host people for their 20-day quarantine. All of the 1,000 rooms were built by Hamas and under the direct supervision of Hamas leaders in Gaza.

Thirdly, as the Israeli occupation has been unwilling to help Gaza to afford respirators and equip new ICU beds, Hamas did its best to afford the urgently needed respirators and equipment to prepare and equip the 100 ICU beds. Hamas did its best to afford the devices, senior Hamas leader Khalil Al-Hayya informed the media. He did not confirm how his movement funded them and when they were issued to the Ministry of Health, but he affirmed: “We are committed to protect the people in Gaza and maintain their well-being, so we had to do our best to afford all their needs.”

Hamas leader Al-Sinwar’s warning to push the Israelis to live in shelters was a response to the Israeli Defence Minister Naftali Bennett, when he announced that any medical aid to be allowed to Gaza must be following the release of the Israeli soldiers, or the bodies of the Israeli soldiers, captured in the Gaza Strip. I think this is the warning that pushed the Israeli occupation to allow the entry of the requested respirators and medical equipment through the World Health Organisation.

The fourth point of success relates to Hamas leader Ismael Haniyeh’s continued mobilising support for the Palestinians of Gaza. I was told by a Hamas leader that when the Qatari Emir pledged millions of US dollars to the Palestinians, Haniyeh asked him to send the assistance allocated to Gaza separately because the Palestinian Authority (PA), which has its own sanctions imposed on Gaza, does not send the portion of the assistance allocated to Gaza.

Another area of achievement concerns the fact that the government in Gaza, run by Hamas, is not plagued with corruption like in the West Bank or the neighbouring states. There is no need to mention the corruption in the neighbouring states, but in the West Bank for example, the PA governor of Bethlehem has stolen shipments of aid offered by charities for the families of the people in quarantine.

The sixth and last point: the Palestinians in Gaza, even the political rivals, trust Hamas’ ability in dealing with threats. For example, Hamas’ opposition who criticise it, acknowledge its ability to afford security inside the besieged enclave and they recognise its efforts. During this time of the coronavirus, all of the Gaza residents, including the rivals of the Hamas’ government are helping it carrying out its duties, because it is universally-believed and recognised that it is a serious threat and that Hamas is the only body able to tackle it.

Gaza has registered only 17 coronavirus cases; all of them contracted the virus either from other countries before returning to Gaza, or from the security services who were guarding them in the quarantine centres. Nine cases have recovered and the others are recovering well, according to the Ministry of Health."

A 34-year-old man, Vincent Adjei, described by the police as the ring leader in the murder of the Assemblymember for Sogakope South, Mawutor Adzahli, and four other alleged accomplices have been remanded to prison custody.

 

 He and the four – Bright Awuya 33; Franklin Tench 22; Ansong Steven 26; and Amos Agbaklah 25 – face conspiracy and murder charges.

 

 They are expected to be in prison until May 26 when they will make their next appearance in court.

 

 According to the police, the five suspects were arrested from different locations across the country.

 

 Meanwhile, the police are encouraging the public to continue to volunteer accurate and timely information to assist in the investigation of the crime.

 

 Mawutor Adzahli was murdered in his house on March 1 by some unknown assailants.

 

 He was shot multiple times in what some believe to be a contract killing, an incident that sparked violent protests in the town. His wife, who was assaulted by the unknown assailants, was said to have collapsed later.

 

 The attackers were said to have refused to accept GHC30,000 offer from the victim’s wife in a plea to save his life, insisting money was not the reason for the attack.

 

 They subsequently snatched the money only after they had shot, stabbed and killed Mawutor.

 

 The main highway linking the Greater Accra region to parts of Volta region through Sogakope, as well as other major roads, were blocked by some angry protestors who have been demanding justice for the assembly member.

 

 They claimed the police could have averted the incident if they were a little proactive.

 

 Former President Jerry John Rawlings announced 25,000 cedis for anyone who offers information leading to the arrest of the killers of the assemblyman. The Volta Regional Minister also announced GHC10,000 bounty on the killers."
74,74,https://www.cosmopolitan.com/uk/love-sex/sex/a32247924/tiger-king-dildo/,PSA: There is now a Joe Exotic Tiger King dildo,Do not click if you're currently eating your breakfast...,www.cosmopolitan.com,"As much as we've been gagging for more Tiger King content since the documentary was released on Netflix, there is one thing we didn't expect to see as a product of the show's success: a Joe Exotic-inspired sex toy. Tiger King TikToks, sure. Memes, absolutely. Louis Theroux sticking his beak in and having an opinion, of course.

Maybe we were naive, but a Tiger King dildo just didn't seem like the natural choice for a piece of TK merch. Anyway, for better or for worse, it exists. And it is quite the specimen.

Naturally, the ""hand-crafted"" eight-incher comes in the classic orange and black tiger print (and an array of colours including rainbow, of course).

The product copy on retailer Uber Kinky's website reads, ""Say ‘Fuck you, Carole Baskin’ with the Sinnovator Tiger King Realistic Dildo!'"" which TBH I find quite offensive, but it is what it is. 



Complete with a Prince Albert penis piercing, a padlock and multiple other piercings down the side, it is basically exactly what Joe Exotic would look like if he were, in fact, a dildo.

It's also compatible with O rings, meaning you can use it as a strap-on, too.

And all for just £109.99 (just kidding, that's really damn expensive). BUT, Uber Kinky will be donating 10% from each purchase to Tiger Watch. And are encouraging fans to, ""Save the tigers, one orgasm at a time.""

76,76,https://news2.onlinenigeria.com/news/general/826373-are-nigerian-varsities-ready-to-go-virtual.html,Are Nigerian varsities ready to go virtual?,,news2.onlinenigeria.com,"FOLLOWING the directive of the Minister of Education, Mallam Adamu Adamu, that tertiary institutions across the country should resume lectures by going virtual in order to cushion the effects of the lockdown occasioned by the ravaging Coronavirus pandemic, reactions have trailed the directive.

Recall that Adamu in a teleconference in Abuja, with 237 Vice Chancellors, Rectors and Provosts last Thursday directed that that varsities, polytechnics and colleges of education should activate their virtual learning environment for students to continue their studies through digital devices.

Adamu had said: “We cannot be held down by COVID-19. We have to deploy all e-platforms to keep our universities, polytechnics, colleges of education and other schools open. COVID-19 has changed everybody. I am pleading with you to devise alternative ways, make sure the education of our children will not stop. We have to create virtual learning environment.

“This is the second meeting I am having. All I want is that we should fully engage our students. We are already speaking with the World Bank and UNICEF on how to create platforms for virtual learning classrooms. We need to take advantage of technology like the case in other parts of the world. We cannot shut down all schools when we have other means to teach our students.” Meanwhile, some academia who spoke to Vanguard argued that the directive cannot be implemented owing to lack of structures and facilities.

A good talk that cannot be implemented now – Prof. Akinfeleye

Reacting to the directive, renowned Mass Communication guru, Prof. Ralph Akinfeleye, stated that the directive cannot hold sway owing to lack of necessary infrastructure such as power and conducive learning environment.

His words: “A good talk, but not achievable for now. The students are all over the country, some of them have not been able to get light for the last three weeks or more; some have light but no computer to work; and even the café is closed due to Coronavirus. So, it’s a good talk but not achievable for now. We need to have constant light for messages if we are going viral for lectures.

“I don’t know the capacity of all the universities, but I know majority do have the capacity to go online. But the point is that going online will not be workable as of now because of shortage of electricity.

“My advice to the government is first of all to solve the Academic Staff Union of Universities, ASUU, issues so that lecturers can go back to classes. And on going virtual, they should put structures in place such as power before rushing into what is happening in US or Europe where they have facilities and uninterrupted power supply; and good environment where they have good food among others.

“I also think what the Minister of Education should do is to appeal to all the Medical Schools to go into laboratories during this period and find the vaccines or the solutions such as providing sanitizers and facemasks for the Coronavirus. Create avenue through campus radio and television to sensitise people on social distancing. The more we are able to do these, the quicker we resume rather than talking of resuming during this dangerous period when he knows it’s not possible.”

Where are the facilities to do online? – Dr. Alawode

For an Associate Lecturer in the School of Communication, (Broadcast Department), Lagos State University, LASU, Dr. Olayinka Alawode, going virtual is not an issue, but the question of facilities. He said: “With which facilities? Laptop, iPad, Internet, electricity. It is not a joke when you hear professors are grappling with poverty. The government should first fulfil the 2009 ASUU/FG Agreement.

“However, universities are ever ready to resume work online and readily available. But as I responded above, basic tools and facilities to work with are just not there. Except you say I commit my meagre salary to this use. Lecturers live in poverty trying their best in all situations. If our universities are equipped up-to-date, we can do all things properly comparable to best international standards. With automatic connection to virtual libraries, we can work effectively from home or anywhere.

“Personally I spend up to 4.5GB internet data monthly and I burn my personal generator close to four hours daily and seven days of the week. That is after driving long distances in traffic jam every day except Sundays that I compel myself to stay home. But, remember, it takes two to tango.

“If I have what it takes to link up my students online? Do all my students have what it takes to link up? Some lecturers are already into online lectures. But not all. Don’t forget, some students come from very poor homes, they cannot even afford five thousand naira small torchlight phone, not to talk of laptop.”

However, the Special Adviser, SA, on Education to Lagos State Governor, Hon. Tokunbo Wahab, stated that institutions in the state are already going virtual. He said: “Our tertiary institutions are going online already.”

The Global President, National Association of Nigerian Students, NANS, Comrade Danielson Akpan, said the directive is not feasible due to lack of basic amenities. According to the NANS president, “The instruction of the minister asking that institutions and lectures should continue virtually is word that cannot hold water at this time. The question is ‘how many institutions have the facility to go online? Even the institution that is established to give lectures virtually, NOUN how efficient is it? Not to talk of universities, colleges of education, polytechnics not used to online to do all their activities.’

“We have hardly even moved away from lecturers using chalks or markers as found in some institutions. Is it where you want to ask lecturers to hold lectures via the Internet? The lockdown is just an opportunity for lecturers to rest, dust their archives, and look at the papers they are yet to mark to make up with it. That is the position of the Nigerian students.”

77,77,https://www.kgoradio.com/2020/04/22/ca-announces-large-expansions-to-covid-testing/,CA Announces Large Expansions to COVID Testing,,www.kgoradio.com,"During today’s daily coronavirus press briefing Governor Gavin Newsom announced 86 new testing sites for COVID-19 as seen in his tweet below.

Newsom explained that back in March, on average there were 2,000 COVID-19 tests given per day. The California government made an announcement aiming to advance to 10,000 tests per day by April 14th. A few days ago there were 14,500 tests given per day and today there are 16,000 tests provided per day.

While that is good news, Newsom believes California can do more. By the end of April, he hopes to be able to provide 25,000 tests per day; with a goal of 60,000 to 80,000 tests per day in the next few months.

With hundreds of testing sites in California, Newsom believes there are 251 core sites making up the backbone of testing residents. When officials asked what the “core sites” are in need of the number one request is swabs.

Governor Newsom said he spoke with President Trump moments before the briefing and explained Californias need for more swabs. In response, Trump said California will receive 100,000 swabs this week, 250,000 swabs next week and should expect to receive a, “Susbstanial increase above 250,000” the following week.

Newsom is remaining committed to having all Californians tested by announcing these new sites which will work on targeting “testing deserts” where people may struggle to gain access to COVID-19 tests. He said the sites will be strategically placed in, “Rural California and deep in urban California to make sure we are truly culturally competent in our testing” as well as in areas that have been hit hard by the virus.

This briefing was the first of Newsom’s promised weekly updates on California’s coronavirus recovery. He will continue his daily press briefings, but will focus on the six key indicators he previously laid out on Wednesdays. The first step of the six is, to, “Monitor and protect communities through testing, contact tracing, isolating & supporting those who are positive or exposed” which he covered in detail today."

“No I don’t agree with him on that. No I think we’re doing a great job on testing. If he said that, I don’t agree with him,” Trump said when asked about Fauci’s comments.

Earlier Thursday, Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, said in an interview that the U.S. needs to “significantly ramp up not only the number of tests, but the capacity to perform them.”

“I am not overly confident right now at all that we have what it takes to do that,” Fauci said.

Fauci is not in Thursday's coronavirus task force meeting.

In the interview, Fauci also called it a ""very critical time right now"" for the nation as it pulls back from coronavirus mitigation.

""When we do start to see cases come back and I'll guarantee you they will — as we pull back from mitigation, we'll be seeing cases. If we have in place the capability to identify by testing, isolate, contact trace, get people out of circulation who are infected, that's called containment. If we are capable of doing that, effectively, then we should feel some good confidence that we can slowly move on,"" said Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a member of the task force.

Fauci said the country is dealing with different stages of the disease, and there is no one-size-fits-all approach.

""We have to realize that we're a large country that has outbreaks in different regions, different states, different cities, that have different dynamics, and different phases in which they are in. And that was the reason why when we put together the guidelines for, as we say the opening America, it was very, very careful and very conservative in making sure that you pass certain gateway points, checkpoints, before you go to the next phase,"" he said.

Fauci added, ""I think sometimes and understandably, people might think that when you get back to normal, it's like a light switch that you turn on or off. It isn't really that at all."""

For instance, following recent cases of persons with the virus visiting several public and private hospitals without even knowing they had contracted the disease already in recent days and the fear it had created in the minds of members of the public, a growing number of Abuja residents are now beginning to shun any form of visits to health facilities just to avoid picking up the virus mistakenly.

As a result of this, many of the city’s residents have resorted to self-medication, allowing operators of pharmacies to smile to the bank.

Explaining why she decided to embrace self-medication, a woman named Stella told SaharaReporters that even doctors and nurses in most hospitals in the city are afraid to attend to patients because they don’t know, who may have the virus already.

She said, “I visited the hospital last week after having malaria symptoms but soon as I got there and explained my situation, a nurse on duty yelled at me not to move closer to her.

“She said it was Coronavirus symptom and that I shouldn’t come close to her because she didn’t have protective gear.

“I managed to find a laboratory to run a test and the result came out that it was indeed malaria. I simply approached a pharmacy for medication to treat myself.

“I have vowed not to go close to a hospital again for now. I will take care of myself my buying drugs from a pharmacy.”

A source at Nyanya General Hospital Abuja, who spoke with SaharaReporters, said some of the doctors there were now giving out telephone numbers to patients to call for treatment advice in order to limit physical contact and reduce the risk of contracting Coronavirus.



 “Most of the doctors are not attending to patients physically again, they have given out their mobile numbers to patients because they are trying to avoid physical interaction with them.

“For now, only few people come to the hospital,” the source said.

A pharmacists, who spoke with our correspondent, also corroborated the situation in Abuja, revealing that there has been a significant increase in sales in recent days especially since the lockdown put in place by government.



 “Business has been good. Though we are not happy about this disease but for us it has boosted our business.

“People have been coming to buy various medicines and other items like face mask, hand sanitisers and medicated soaps more than we have witnessed in the past. It has been a good time for those of us in this business,” one pharmacy operator in the city told our correspondent.

President of Nigerian Medical Association, Mr Francis Faduyile, told SaharaReporters that inadequate supply of Personal Protection Equipment was responsible for the decision of some doctors not to attend to patients physically.

He said, “We have on several occasions discussed that it is wrong for people to self medicate.

“We have doctors who are professionals who can investigate, diagnose and prescribe drugs to treat cases.

“If they are now resorting to e-consultations, it is good but it must be done in a way that patients will have the best treatment.”"

The facility is locating in the car park of Port Glasgow Health Centre in Inverclyde, and was set up on April 9.

NHS bosses had said it would allow up to 100 people a week to be tested, with the aim of helping 400 frontline health workers a month return to work.

But now, neighbours nearby claim 'around four people a day' are being tested.

A resident, speaking on condition of anonymity, told our sister paper the Greenock Telegraph: ""It has been very quiet so far.

""It looks like they are testing about four people a day.

""We overlook it and have barely noticed anyone using the centre.

""It is empty most of the time.

""Surely there should be more people getting tested?""

A spokesman NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said: ""At present the centre is seeing more patients on a daily basis and has the capacity to meet demand.

""The Port Glasgow drive-through testing centre opened on Thursday April 9 and tests both symptomatic household members and symptomatic staff as per the current NHS GGC policy.

""Across NHS GGC we are able to test health and social care staff who are self-isolating as they are symptomatic, or, those with a symptomatic household contact.""

The drive-through test centre runs on an appointment-only basis and it operates Monday to Friday from 9am to 4pm.

Gonzalez’s video — which was aptly supplemented with the opening to LL Cool J’s “Mama Said Knock You Out” — followed Rob Gronkowski’s decision to come out of retirement.

Gonzalez mused that he, too, would be coming out of retirement (via Jon Heath of USA TODAY):

The former Kansas City Chiefs legend also tagged the team’s Instagram account, prompting a response from Von Miller.

The Broncos linebacker commented “Please try to block me Tony!!! I would love that!!!” before also commenting a goat emoji to acknowledge how he truly feels about Gonzalez’s place in the game.

The 31-year-old Miller is in his own battle with the trenches after having contracted coronavirus, though he said last week he is in stable condition.

Broncos General Manager John Elway has done quite a bit to supplement Miller with some stellar defensive pieces. Elway traded for cornerback A.J. Bouye and also acquired former Tennessee Titans defensive tackle Jurrell Casey for the cost of just a seventh-round pick.

Miller had his fewest sacks (8.0) since 2013 last season, but he should benefit from the addition of Casey as well as the return of Bradley Chubb on the edge. Chubb dominated prior to a season-ending injury, and he might help draw more attention for the Broncos and away from Miller.

Denver’s interior looks scary for any opposing offensive line, much less a retired tight end like Gonzalez."

Justice Yogesh Khanna, who conducted the hearing through video conferencing, granted the relief to the man on furnishing of a personal bond of Rs 25,000 and a surety of the like amount.

Considering the above facts as also the age of the applicant, being 94 years, I admit the applicant...to bail, the judge said.

The case related to murder of a woman, who was a tenant in the man's Model Town-II house, in 2011. A murder case was lodged by the police as the woman's body had injuries and strangulation marks on neck.

Another FIR, for alleged offence of kidnapping with an intent to secretly confine a person, was also filed on the complaint of the woman's brother who was apprehensive of the suspicious role of the landlord and his wife.

There had been some dispute between the parties on vacation of the premises.

On the basis of statement of a witness, the elderly man was charged for the offence of murder and was taken into custody in February this year.

The high court, while granting him bail, perused the February 27 order on the charge passed by the trial court and said the only ground for that appeared to be that he being the ultimate beneficiary of vacating of the premises by the deceased tenant.

Both the status report as also the order on charge do not refer to any piece of evidence qua the direct involvement of applicant (man) in the crime. Rather the status report shows that the co-accused had informed this applicant that the deceased had vacated the premises, it said."

The 26 ships with current cases are in port or maintenance yards, the official stressed.

The Navy is not releasing the names of the individual ships impacted or the exact number of cases because Defense Department policy states that it would risk operational security if the details became public.

There are currently 90 ships at sea with no reported cases and the Navy currently has 297 active duty warships.

As of Wednesday morning, 3,578 US service members have tested positive for the virus, including two deaths. Nearly 800 of those cases have come from the outbreak aboard the USS Theodore Roosevelt aircraft carrier where one sailor also died.

More than 4,000 sailors on the Roosevelt had been moved ashore and were scheduled to begin returning to the ship this coming weekend after finishing a 14-day isolation period but that process has been paused because 120 previously asymptomatic sailors tested positive.

As a result the Navy has decided to keep all personnel already ashore in place until it can learn more about how the virus remains active in an asymptomatic person.

In a message to his forces obtained by CNN, Pacific Fleet commander, Admiral John Aquilino directed the halting of the release of crew members from “isolation and quarantine” over concerns some may test positive after being released. He added that “that this will delay progress” towards “deploying units” and emphasized “we must take this action to ensure we get underway with healthy crews.”

The Roosevelt’s commander Capt. Brett Crozier was fired earlier this month for what the then acting Navy Secretary Thomas Modly said was poor judgment for too widely disseminating a warning about the spread of virus aboard his vessel, a warning that eventually made its way into the press.

Modly resigned days later over his handling of the incident, actions which included a $240,000 trip to Guam where he slammed Crozier and admonished sailors for giving him a rousing send off in public remarks to the crew.

Last week the Navy and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention launched an investigation into the outbreak aboard the Roosevelt.

That inquiry will look to establish the origin of the outbreak and understand how it spread rapidly on board the ship.

The results of a separate Navy investigation into the circumstances of Crozier’s memo is expected soon and it is possible he could be reinstated.

“This is a stealthy virus in many ways and this outbreak investigation is an important medical weapon to understand its behaviour so that we can better protect the crew, their shipmates on other vessels and ultimately the nation,” Rear Adm. Bruce Gillingham, US Navy Surgeon General said on Friday.

To carry out the investigation, crew members are being asked on a voluntary basis to complete a survey and provide two new specimens -- blood and nasal swabs -- for laboratory testing, according to the Navy. It hopes to get 1,000 volunteers which is what it believes is needed for representative sampling."

The 10-to-12-tonne vehicle was developed from an older model over a year and half, and has been deployed on site in the Dutch city of Almere.



A roller is a relatively easy vehicle to electrify as it does not have to perform repetitive heavy lifting or prolonged excavation, and does not require a long driving range.



The electric vehicle’s carbon emissions are reduced by approximately 236kg per day, a reduction of 42,000kg a year compared with a petrol or diesel-powered roller. A full charge takes three to five hours, and will last eight hours.

Koob Bovenhuis, BAM Infra Materieel’s manager, said: “This has been an incredible achievement and a fine example of the expertise and can-do mindset of our people. 



“From the initial idea during a strategy session, it’s taken us just one-and-a-half years to make the electric road roller a reality.”



Bam plans to use the roller on more projects in the future, and is working on creating a fully emission-free paving train.

89,89,https://www.naturalnews.com/2020-04-22-doctors-concerned-skin-recovering-covid-19-patients-turns-dark-brown.html,Doctors concerned as skin of recovering COVID-19 patients in China turns dark brown,,www.naturalnews.com,"(Natural News) We’re still in the process of learning about what life is like for those who have survived coronavirus infections. Anyone who has overcome the virus has plenty to be thankful for, but it’s often a difficult road to return to normal. And in the case of a pair of Chinese doctors, it’s also going to take some time before they look normal again as reports are emerging that the virus completely changed their natural skin tone to a far darker one.

The two men, both aged 42, were diagnosed with COVID-19 in January while working as physicians treating patients at the Wuhan Central Hospital in the epicenter of the outbreak. They were transferred between different hospitals after becoming gravely ill, and after being placed on life support, their skin color changed dramatically.

The transformation is being attributed to hormonal imbalances resulting from liver damage sustained but the virus, according to Chinese state media. However, one of the men in question, Dr. Yi Fan, who is a cardiologist, suspects that a drug they were given at the beginning of their treatment is behind the effect. The drug was not named.

Dr. Yi was hooked up to a life support machine known as an ECMO for 39 days. The machine pumps and oxygenates a person’s blood outside of their body much in the same way that a heart-lung bypass machine does in open-heart surgery.

The doctor said he was scared when he first learned of his condition and had frequent nightmares. Although he’s now able to move around normally in his bed, walking without support is a struggle.

The other affected physician, Dr. Hu Weifeng, was bedridden for 99 days and was very weak after his surgery. The urologist underwent ECMO therapy for 45 days and recently regained his ability to speak.

His physician, Dr. Li Shusheng, said that the patients should return to their normal skin tone once their liver function improves. In addition to their medical treatment, they’re also being given mental health support.

The two doctors had both worked with Dr. Li Wenliang, the whistleblower who first drew attention to the virus and later supposedly died from it.

What is coronavirus recovery like?

Those lucky enough to survive COVID-19 often face a tough road to recovery, although how long and difficult it is depends on how sick patients were in the first place. Some people will bounce back relatively quickly, while others could have long-lasting health issues.

Another factor is the duration and invasiveness of their treatment. Generally speaking, however, it takes two weeks to recover, on average, with the fever subsiding within about a week and the cough often lingering.

For those who experience more serious symptoms requiring oxygen therapy, recovery could take as long as eight weeks, and many people report a lingering sense of tiredness.

The 1 in 20 who require a stint in the intensive care unit, which may involve sedation and a ventilator, will need far longer to recover. Anyone spending time in critical care for any reason can take as long as a year and half to return to normal, especially if they spent a long time there and experienced muscle mass loss.

In China and Italy, recovering patients have reported weakness throughout their body, becoming short of breath even after minimal exertion, and extreme tiredness.

There are also psychological wounds to heal. People who experience acute respiratory distress syndrome and need to be put on a ventilator may be asked if they wish to say goodbye to their family prior to be putting to sleep for the procedure. This is a trauma that can leave lasting scars and lead to post-traumatic stress disorder.

Surviving COVID-19 is certainly something to celebrate, but it can be a long time before people feel – and in some cases, look – like themselves again."

Data from the national statistics agency showed consumer prices rose by 2.08% in the year through early April, undershooting a Reuters poll forecast of 2.19%.

That was the lowest level since a rate of 2.00% in December 2015. Nevertheless, the core inflation index, which strips out some volatile food and energy costs, stood at a rate of 3.40%, slightly above the 3.36% forecast by the poll.

Mexico’s economy is expected to suffer its biggest contraction in years in 2020 due to the impact of the novel coronavirus, and the central bank on Tuesday cut its benchmark lending rate by 50 basis points to 6%.

Still, Mexico’s key interest rate is far higher than in the leading western economies, and analysts expect borrowing costs to fall further in the months ahead.

The central bank targets an inflation rate of 3% with a tolerance of one percentage point above or below that.

The latest data showed consumer prices fell 0.72% during the first half of April compared with the previous two-week period. The core price index climbed 0.20% over the period."

Mr. Beard was preceded in death by his parents; his daughter, Laurie; and sister, Molly Johnston and is survived by his wife Sally Beard; his son Chuck Beard and his wife Melinda; granddaughters, Lauren and Katie; and his twin brothers, Kay and David Beard; as well as several nieces and nephews. 

 Due to current family medical conditions with restrictions and current social distancing requirements, the family is not prepared to have visitors at this time. 

 Mr. Beard will be laid to rest in a private graveside service on Friday, April 24, 2020 at Greenwood Cemetery in Weatherford. As such, there is no need for flowers or other such outreach. All are encouraged to direct any remembrances to Shriner's Hospitals for Children or St Jude Children's Research Hospital. 

 Charles was born in the family home located in Springtown, Texas, on Mar 8, 1937. He was the oldest of four children born to his parents, Walter Prewett Beard and Helen Louise Warn Beard. 

 Charles married Sally Ann Colgin and spent 58 years building a life with their two children, Laurie and Chuck Beard. 

 The young Charles wore many hats - he was the youngest person to receive his Texas Chauffeur's license at the age of 13. 

 Charles worked at Fort Wolters where he was recognized multiple times for his designs and innovations that not only improved the water treatment plant but saved the U.S. Department of the Army hundreds of thousands of dollars annually. 

 He worked as an ambulance driver, was a county Fire Marshal, and as a salesman for Harris and Motorola, all while building his first company, CSSI. 

 He built CSSI into the 6th largest PCP paging company in the world. He designed the first two-way system for Parker County. He built the Southern Pacific Railroad radio system as well as the single sideband system for Brown and Root, the largest fleet ships in the world. He maintained Parkland Hospital's Paging System and the Carswell Air Force Base's Radio System for many years. 

 Internationally, he designed and sold systems to the President of Mexico, the Prince of Kuwait, the Nigerian Government and the Egyptian Secret Service. In 1996, he tried his hand at terrestrial radio. He bought Weatherford's radio station, KZEE (you may have even heard his reporting live ""from the scene"" an expanded multi-station network which remains broadcasting today. 

 As much as he enjoyed his work, he always found time for family and his community. He enjoyed politics, gardening, wood-working, and photography but mostly his granddaughters. Nothing brought him as much joy as his two ""partners in crime."" Never missing a second, he enjoyed every aspect of being a grandparent and could not have been prouder of his girls. ""Poppy"" will be forever missed as the world continues to turn."

Here’s what it means.,,www.mlive.com,"ALLEN PARK -- The Detroit Lions have had a lot of contact with Clemson do-everything Isaiah Simmons during the pre-draft process, according to ESPN.

So what does it mean?

The Lions have talked to perhaps hundreds of prospects going back to the Shrine Bowl and especially the Senior Bowl (at which they coached). They talked to tons of guys at the combine, and more during video calls in recent weeks. So it’s not exactly a surprise they were doing their homework on one of the five guys they’re most likely to take with the third overall pick in the entire draft.

Related: Why Isaiah Simmons is one of the 5 likeliest choices for Detroit

Last year, the Lions did a ton of work on T.J. Hockenson. They talked a lot to the player, and they talked a lot to the folks in that Iowa program (which is headed by Kirk Ferentz, a branch of the Bill Belichick coaching tree, which certainly played into the evaluation). Detroit wound up taking the tight end eighth overall.

But the year before that, they showed very little interest at all to Frank Ragnow. They had one formal meeting with the Arkansas center at the combine, and that was it. There was no contact with Ragnow after that, and certainly no visit to Allen Park. Then Detroit took him 20th overall.

“To be honest, I was pretty surprised,” Ragnow said that day. “They actually mentioned that on the phone, that they really tried to keep it under the radar -- their interest in me -- and I was very surprised.""

The Lions didn’t travel to Arkansas to work him out. They didn’t bring him to Allen Park for a pre-draft visit. They didn’t even ask Ragnow where he’d be on draft night, as is customary with potential targets. They went completely dark on a guy they took 20th overall.

“The last time we talked to him was at the combine,” Lions general manager Bob Quinn said. “We had a good meeting there. He was a guy that was pretty clean through the process. He’s coming back from an injury that he missed the second half of the season with an ankle. Other than the injury, he was a real clean prospect that I didn’t really feel like we needed to do a whole lot of extra work on in terms of visit here or private workout or any of those things.”

So, yeah. It doesn’t move the needle whatsoever the Lions had a lot of contact with Simmons during this draft process. Of course they were doing their homework on the versatile linebacker. And even if they weren’t, Simmons could still get that call from a 3-1-3 tonight."

As we eagerly await a return to normalcy, many say we can aspire to do better &mdash;",www.europesun.com,"Dystopian fiction seems so alluring during the coronavirus pandemic. As we eagerly await a return to normalcy, many say we can aspire to do better - whether we are talking about wealth distribution or global warming. What dystopian fiction does especially well is to show how we can do more than simply repeat.

Steven Spielberg's Ready Player One (2018), an adaptation of Ernest Cline's bestselling novel of the same title (2011), is a case in point. Set in 2045 in the city of Columbus, Ohio, it speaks of a world that has weathered corn syrup droughts and bandit riots.

People have now resorted to outliving rather than fixing the world's problems. Accordingly, a virtual reality game known as the OASIS has become a refuge for many, including the central protagonist Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan).

Small wonder that the OASIS is so appealing. Within its walls, Spielberg pays homage to many aspects of popular culture. The video game Minecraft (2009) is a possible setting, and throughout the film, viewers watch Chucky, the Iron Giant and Mechagodzilla in battle.

Entire plot sequences incorporate existing popular characters, music and stories. In a nod to Superman, Watts dons Clark Kent glasses to conceal his identity. And in a sequence worthy of the film's 2019 Academy Award nomination for Achievement in Visual Effects, Watts and his romantic interest Samantha Cook (Olivia Cooke) dance to the Bee Gees' ""Stayin' Alive"" (1977).

The central conflict in Ready Player One arises when James Halliday (Mark Rylance), one of the OASIS's creators, dies and leaves behind a seemingly impossible quest. The prize is his extensive fortune and total control over the OASIS. Watts' competitors include the Innovative Online Industries (IOI), a loyalty centre that seeks to take over the OASIS.

The IOI is shown to be exploitative. Samantha's father, we learn, borrowed gaming gear, built up debt and moved into the IOI in hopes to repay it, only to fall ill and die. Samantha stands to follow his example and her debt has already exceeded 23,000 credits.

What distinguishes the film - and its source material - is its exploration of how we negotiate with a social order rife with inequalities. This theme is particularly timely: COVID-19 has made apparent, for instance, the links between inequality and public health.

In the novel, the IOI's corporate police arrest Wade, and he is marshalled out of his apartment complex and into a transport truck. As the vehicle moves, he peers out of its window and absorbs the changes that have befallen the world:

The key term here is neglect. Wade is not alone in having forsaken the world. The virtual universe of the OASIS may have provided a convenient refuge. But choosing to escape the world's realities has contributed to a dramatic rise in social and economic inequalities.

Both Cline's novel and Spielberg's film trace Watts' growth into a better global citizen and his reconnection to the real world, so that his triumph can entail more than the regeneration of a flawed system. Spielberg expands on the novel by exploring what Watts does with his new-found wealth and power.

Watts shares his gains with his friends and together they take constructive steps towards improving both the OASIS and the wider world: they employ Halliday's friend Ogden (Simon Pegg) as a non-exclusive consultant. They also ban loyalty centres from accessing the OASIS and switch off the virtual world on Tuesdays and Thursdays to encourage people to spend more time in the real world.

All of these actions seem commendable and they reveal how different Watts and his friends are to Halliday. Yet the film also exposes paradoxes inherent in fixing a broken system with its very tools.

In a recent article on the novel that I wrote with James Munday, a mathematics and statistics undergraduate student, we argue that any major change Wade makes to the OASIS, such as closing it for extended periods, demands that he and his fellow shareholders take on a substantial loss: their power is contingent upon the OASIS after all. But Wade seeks a more selfless and heroic win: creating a system that answers the needs of the many.

What Spielberg does especially well is to show the importance of imagining the world in new ways - and the temptation and problems with rebuilding a broken one in its own image.

In this, Spielberg harks back to a long genealogy of dystopian fiction, a genre invested in world building. The problems that Watts faces are anticipated, for instance, in George Orwell's Animal Farm (1945), where we find an exploitative social system replaced by one even more so because it is more efficient.

Recently, Gregory Claeys provided us with an interdisciplinary map of the genre in his illuminating study Dystopia: A Natural History. In a short essay, he draws connections between the fears that we feel in these times of uncertainty to the genre's central concerns.

As we collectively meditate on the world's problems, why not imagine better worlds?"

Roosevelt’s Civilian Conservation Corps and Works Progress Administration mobilized millions of Americans during one of the most trying times in our nation’s history, our new Health Force will help bolster the COVID-19 response and put Americans back to work serving their communities and their country.”

The Health Force would conduct testing and contact tracing, and eventually would provide vaccinations for the coronavirus. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would have responsibility for training the workers, and state and local health agencies would oversee their deployment.

However, the duties of the anticipated 1 million trainees would be broader than provision of medical services. The proposal envisions that workers would share public health information with communities, deliver food and medicine to those who are elderly or have underlying health conditions, and also be involved in hospice care.

When the COVID-19 pandemic draws to a close, the Health Force would shift to providing technical assistance for health agencies around the country as they hire health workers in underserved areas. In addition to responding to future public health emergencies, Health Force members would connect people with health resources and provide senior citizens or new mothers with home health checks.

Embedded within Bennet's bill is a proposed ""Resiliency Force,"" which would operate in a similar manner to the Health Force, but would recruit employees for the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

A spokesperson for Bennet said the name is not a reference to the recently established Space Force."

On Monday night, OPP arrested three suspects following reports of individuals removing licence plates from a vehicle on St. Luke’s Road near Downeyville, Ont.

OPP say the suspects initially fled in a vehicle and were briefly pursued until police halted due to safety concerns.

The vehicle was reportedly located a short time later, and OPP say the suspects fled on foot. They were tracked and arrested by the OPP’s canine unit, emergency response team and a front-line officer.

OPP on Thursday released details of their charges.

Matthew Pidgeon-Wallace, 25, of Douro-Dummer Township, was charged with:
• Three counts of possession of property obtained by crime over $5,000
• Two counts of theft under $5,000
• Possession of property obtained by crime under $5,000

Kathleen Laffan, 33, of Pickering, was charged with:
• Possession of property obtained by crime over $5,000
• Possession of property obtained by crime under $5,000
• Failure to comply with a release order other than to attend court
• Four counts of failure to comply with a probation order

Corrado Zagarella, 34, of Toronto, was charged with:
• Possession of property obtained by crime over $5,000
• Two counts of theft under $5,000
• Possession of property obtained by crime under $5,000
• Four counts of failure to comply with a probation order

They were held in custody and appeared in court in Lindsay on Tuesday.

“The suspects are believed to be involved in a number of current incidents related to vehicle thefts,” OPP stated Thursday. “Initial investigation has led to the identification of a fourth suspect, whose whereabouts is [sic] still being sought by the OPP.”

Anyone having information on this crime is asked to contact the City of Kawartha Lakes OPP at 1-888-310-1122 or anonymously contact Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-8477 (TIPS) or online."

Lionel Shriver, the very outspoken author of ""We Need to Talk About Kevin"" and the forthcoming novel ""The Motion of the Body Through Space,"" reads Pushkin in Russian, learns Greek and imagines a world with no book sales.

“You know, I’m glad for the lockdown,” I say reflectively. “All this opportunity for contemplation and solitude. And the social solidarity is so uplifting.”

“Yes,” Jeff says. “Social solidarity is a lot easier when you don’t see anybody.”

I return to “Remembrance of Things Past,” because during this becalming stasis it makes sense to read a book in which nothing happens. Jeff picks thoughtfully at the sitar he ordered on Amazon. I’ve always wanted to read Proust, Jeff has always wanted to learn the sitar, and thanks to the British government we can fulfill our dreams.

I head to the Tesco Metro covered in “PPE” (gotta dig all our hip new lingo). Silent, wary social-distance queuing with fellow Londoners I’ve learned to spurn as leaky vessels of lethal contagion means a 15-minute trip now takes two hours. Again I relish the extended meditation and chance for inner wisdom. Lately I really know myself, right? So it hardly matters that I don’t know anyone else.

Jeff and I take a lingering online tour of the British Museum, gawking at big chunks of rock that have endured, stoic and implacable, for thousands of years. Their defiant inertia seems to be telling us something. They’re not going anywhere. So what’s our problem?

At dinner I remark beamingly, “I’m pleased we agreed not to drink during this period of enlightenment and cultural enrichment. The mental clarity is so refreshing.”

This evening, I read Pushkin aloud in Russian. Jeff doesn’t speak Russian but he gets so caught up in the rolling rhythms of the poems that he is moved to tears. I am so moved that he is moved that I cry too. Then Jeff is moved that I am moved that he is moved, and the sofa gets terribly wet. We have tender tantric sex, because we’ve never been this close. Cheers, Boris Johnson.

“I confess,” I ruminate at dinner, “I was peevish at first that my new novel will be released into a black hole, with no bookstores or promotional events. But maybe next month’s publication date is another lucky break. Isn’t selling one’s work a little grubby?”

“An audience for any true work of art,” I say with a returning excitement, “is also a defilement. Surely there’s a purity to a novel no one reads. Reading is a kind of contamination — or appropriation.”

“I feel the same way about jazz,” Jeff says vigorously. “When anyone listens to me drum, they interfere with the music. If clubbers pay a cover charge, the relationship is transactional. The music becomes about money — in a way, it becomes money. I’m so relieved that, on the other side of this, all the venues will be bankrupt and replaced with pawnshops and off-track betting. That way I can play all by myself, like a real pro.”

I pat my husband’s thigh with a touch of condescension. “Oh, honey. You’re right about how fortunate you are to be shed of a viable occupation. But ‘on the other side of this’? Who said anything about another side?” I take my 2020 diary to bed and put big, joyous black X’s through “Reviewers’ Dinner,” “Book Launch,” “Solo Spectator event at Emmanuel Centre,” “Swiss Festival,” “Ely Festival,” “Bath Festival,” “Dublin Festival"" and “Hay Festival,” and then let Jeff do the honors on his own account. He strikes through “JW tour of Portugal” and “JW tour for ‘Bloom’ with Carmen Staaf and Michael Formanek” with a zestful flourish. Jeff and I divide up the parts of Ibsen’s “An Enemy of the People” and perform the script aloud. I decide it’s time I learned Greek. I learn Greek. Then I learn to play the violin. It takes a few minutes but within the hour I can get through the Prokofiev Violin Concerto #2 at a good pace. Jeff is doing an online course on Indonesian cooking. I take up watercolors. Then I knit bright woolen masks for the National Health Service. At 8 p.m. we lean out our front windows and bang pots with wooden spoons to express our gratitude for NHS staff. We feel a warm glow of conformity. The dented pots are ruined, but that’s all right because banging out the window makes so much difference to what happens. I’ve been managing emotionally but today I’m anxious. Britain’s “three-week” lockdown is closing on four weeks. How will the government keep us safe? Worried, after destroying our cookware, we turn on the news. Dominic Raab announces that the lockdown will last three more weeks. “It was super important he didn’t even hint when we’re going to ‘exit,’” Jeff says appreciatively. “The British are a dim and impulsive people, and at even the word ‘exit’ they’d all rush into the street and start licking each other.” Lionel Shriver’s new novel, “The Motion of the Body Through Space,” is out in May. Please don’t despoil it by ordering a copy."

Premier John Horgan wants to beef up provincial benefits for sick employees, following a large COVID-19 outbreak at a Vancouver poultry processing plant.",www.cbc.ca,"B.C. Premier John Horgan wants to beef up provincial benefits for sick employees, following a large COVID-19 outbreak at a Vancouver poultry processing plant.

Twenty-eight employees at United Poultry Company Ltd. have tested positive for the virus, prompting health officials to temporarily shut down the plant.

The premier called the situation ""disappointing,"" suggesting the outbreak occurred because United employees were worried about losing pay if they called in sick.

""Sick pay is there, not just to give extra dollars to people who are ill,"" he said, ""but perhaps ensure those workers don't come to work, because they know they're not going to forego their wages for the day.""

Horgan said he plans to meet with Labour Minister Harry Bains and WorkSafeBC officials to discuss sick pay provisions.

More time and more space needed to keep employees safe

Union representatives, though, say sick pay is only part of the equation when it comes to keeping employees safe.

Kim Novak, the president of UFCW 1518, which represents several poultry plants in British Columbia, says the outbreak should serve as a wake-up call for anyone running a food processing plant.

Watch | Premier John Horgan talks about the perils of coming to work sick

Novak says it's not enough to simply provide personal protective equipment. Employers need to give staff extra time to sanitize their stations and enough space to take a break.

""Traditionally in a plant you have very full lunch rooms,"" she said. ""Many of the plants we represent have brought in tents and trailers and other spaces, so that distancing is happening.""

United Poultry workers do not have a union.

B.C.'s top health officials say more needs to be done to maintain B.C.'s firewall against COVID-19.

On Wednesday, Health Minister Adrian Dix and provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry revealed a spike in new COVID-19 cases, reminding the public that the situation with the virus is still very fluid and a different mindset is required.

""Sometimes, I think, there's a sense that it's the brave thing to do, or the courageous thing to do, to play hurt or work sick"" said Dix

""That can no longer be the case and that is the responsibility of employers and employees"".

Henry said employees should not be penalized for staying home sick, suggesting public efforts to physically distance could be quickly undone if businesses fail to follow the proper protocols.

""If we start having these types of outbreaks and spread in our community, we can overwhelm our system,"" she said

""And that's what we've been working so hard to avoid""."

The Latest on the coronavirus pandemic. The new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms for most people. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness or death.

— WHO regrets the U.S. decision to halt funding.

—Trudeau says Canada’s lockdown will last ‘many more weeks.’

LONDON — A pregnant nurse who tested positive for COVID-19 has died after undergoing an emergency caesarean to save her child.

The Bedfordshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust says Mary Agyeiwaa Agyapong died Sunday and “was a fantastic nurse and a great example of what we stand for.’’

An internal staff email sent to her colleagues at Luton and Dunstable Hospital says the decision to perform the caesarean came after her condition deteriorated. Channel 4 News, which first reported the tragedy, said doctors initially thought Agyapong was showing signs of improving, but her symptoms got worse.

The NHS Trust’s chief executive, David Carter, told Channel 4 that the little girl’s survival was a “beacon of light at this very dark time.”

WASHINGTON — U.S. law enforcement officials say more than 130 investigations have been launched around the country into fraud and other crimes linked to the COVID-19 outbreak.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations says its agents have so far made nine arrests and executed seven search warrants as part of an effort with other law enforcement agencies to crack down on fake virus tests and treatments and personal protective equipment and other attempts to take advantage of the health crisis.

The agency announced the start of “Operation Stolen Promise” in response to what it called a “significant rise in criminal activity.”

HSI said it has seized more than $3 million in illicit proceeds and shut down 11,000 domain names connected to allegedly fraudulent schemes.

Agents expect the amount of fraud will increase as financial relief and federal stimulus money starts to filter through the U.S. economy in the coming weeks.

BRUSSELS — Belgium, the home of famous summer festivals like Tomorrowland and Rock Werchter, is banning such mass gatherings until the end of August.

Belgian Prime Minister Sophie Wilmes said at the same time it is in talks to see to what extent the major soccer league could start its games in August behind closed doors.

Organizers had been expecting such a move. Still, Rock Werchter said in a statement “we are devastated,” before adding “there are more important things in life right now.” Tomorrowland said that “this situation is extremely hard on us all. As a community, we are sad, disappointed, and angry — but also hopeful, because we know that we are much stronger than this setback.”

TORONTO — Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says Canada’s lockdown will last “many more weeks” and warned Canadians if the economy is reopened too soon all the sacrifices they are making now might be for nothing as the country could see another peak in coronavirus cases.

Trudeau says Canada is still “a number of weeks away” from being able to start to reopen and urged Canadians to be patient.

He says once there is some reopening there is going to be a need for rapid testing on a wide scale and extensive contact tracing for those who test positive. He says once Canada is past the first wave government needs to have the capacity to stamp out any future outbreaks.

His remarks are his strongest yet against loosening economic restrictions too soon.

Canada has more than 27,557 confirmed cases including 954 deaths.

BERLIN — Germany plans to let small shops reopen as early as next week after a four-week coronavirus shutdown, but Europe’s biggest economy is keeping strict social distancing rules in place.

After much-anticipated talks with Germany’s 16 state governors, Chancellor Angela Merkel set out a plan for the first steps of a slow restart of public life.

A ban on gatherings of more than two people in public has been in place since March 23 and was due to run until Sunday. Merkel says the restrictions will remain in place, and officials will review at the end of the month what happens after May 3.

Nonessential shops also have been closed for nearly four weeks. Other shops of up to 800 square meters (8,600 square feet) will be allowed to start reopening, with hygiene precautions. Merkel says the decision applies to the period from Monday though May 3.

ROME — Italy’s daily increase in COVID-19 cases has continued to slow.

The day-to-day increase of 2,667 confirmed cases that was announced by authorities was the lowest in some five weeks and represented a less than 1.7% increase compared to the total cases of the previous day. The number of intensive care beds occupied by patients with coronavirus infections also kept dropping.

Other encouraging numbers were registered in Lombardy, the northern region which by far has had the heaviest case load. Lombardy saw 827 more cases since a day earlier, but past days had brought day-to-day increases of 1,000 or much more. Italy now has more than 165,000 known cases of COVID-19.

WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump has repeatedly touted the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for the new coronavirus, but pilots who take it will have to wait 48 hours before flying.

The Federal Aviation Administration says it reviewed hydroxychloroquine and closely related chloroquine when they became available. The drugs “have long been considered generally incompatible for those performing safety related aviation duties,” reads an FAA statement.

The safety agency cites the “wide variety of dosages” and lack of standards around using the drugs to treat the coronavirus in deciding that pilots who take them must wait before flying.

BRUSSELS — Belgium is extending many of its key lockdown rules for two weeks but is planning to start reopening up the economy after May 3.

Prime Minister Sophie Wilmes says any loosening of rules would depend on the cases continuing to taper off over the next weeks. Originally the lockdown rules would have expired after the weekend but the intensity of the pandemic has forced the government to extend the situation.

“It is very clear that the crisis is not behind us,” Wilmes says. “We have to continue our efforts without weakening,”

She says garden centers and do-it-yourself shops could open under the same conditions as essential food stores now.

ATHENS, Greece — Greek officials are cautioning against early talk of lifting the country’s lockdown, noting that any measures will have to be very seriously weighed and the effects of restrictions being eased abroad studied.

Greece has reported 22 new infections and one new death from COVID-19, bringing the total of infections to 2,192 and deaths to 102.

CAIRO — Sudan has suspended prayers in mosques and churches across the capital of Khartoum, state-run media reported.

It’s the latest action in the government’s gradual tightening of anti-coronavirus measures as the official case count climbed to 32, including five fatalities.

Earlier this week the government decided to lock down the capital for three weeks starting on Saturday. The round-the-clock curfew poses a challenge for the densely populated state of Khartoum, where the World Bank says 26% are destitute and many live in packed areas with poor sanitation and neglected health care.

LONDON — The head of the World Health Organization says it regrets the U.S. decision to halt funding.

Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus says the U.S. has been “a longstanding and generous friend to WHO and we hope it will continue to be so.”

He made the comments after President Donald Trump announced a halt to U.S. funding, temporarily suspending millions of dollars from the U.N health agency’s biggest funder.

Tedros says WHO remained committed to slowing the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and it would work with its partners to ensure that any funding shortfall could be met.

“COVID-19 does not discriminate between rich nations and poor, large nations and small,” Tedros said. “This is a time for all of us to be united in our common struggle against a common threat, a dangerous enemy. When we’re divided, the virus exploits the cracks between us.”

Tedros says WHO’s member countries and independent organizations will assess the U.N. health agency’s performance at a later day. But the focus must remain on ending the outbreak.

DUBAI — The world’s wealthiest countries have agreed to immediately suspend billions of dollars in debt payments for the world’s poorest countries as nations race to spend money on health care and workers impacted by the pandemic.

The Group of 20 nations, which include the U.S., China, India, Germany, France and others, agreed unanimously Wednesday on the suspension of debt payments at a virtual summit of finance ministers that was presided over by Saudi Arabia.

Saudi Finance Minister Mohammed al-Jadaan said after the meeting, “All bilateral official creditors will participate in this initiative, which is an important milestone for the G-20.”

The G-20 didn’t say how many countries would be impacted, but French Finance minister Bruno Le Maire says 76 countries were eligible to the moratorium.

WASHINGTON — Most states are paying out the extra $600 per week in unemployment benefits that was provided in the $2.2 trillion federal economic relief package approved last month.

At least 32 states, including California, Texas and New York, have started or will start making the payments this week.

Still, as of late Tuesday, many states were still scrambling to process the extra funds, including Washington state, Ohio, Wisconsin and Nevada.

DORAL, Fla. — The Trump golf resort in South Florida where President Donald Trump initially wanted to host this year’s Group of Seven summit has temporarily laid off 560 workers.

A notice that the Trump National Doral Miami filed with the State of Florida at the end of last month says it had been forced to halt its business because of the spreading new coronavirus.

The resort in metro Miami has been closed since mid-March. Al Linares, the resort’s director of human resources, wrote to state and city officials that its unknown when it will resume regular operations.

The laid off workers are mostly food and beverage workers, golf attendants, housekeepers and bell hops. None of the workers are unionized.

MOSCOW — Russian President Vladimir Putin has presented new measures to support business, including direct financial aid and state-supported loans.

Putin says the state will provide small- and medium business with direct financial support to help pay salaries to employees . The amount of aid will be calculated on official minimal wage, now equivalent to about $160 a month.

Also, businesses will be offered state-guaranteed loans for salary payments and government low-rate loans for companies to finance their operational costs.

The measures follow broad criticism of the Kremlin for the failure to shore up the businesses hurt by the partial economic shutdown through April 30.

Separately, the federal government will allocate 200 billion rubles (about $2.7 billion) in subsidies to the regions to help fund local programs supporting businesses. Putin also ordered the Cabinet to offer support to various industries, including $307 million to air carriers.

WASHINGTON — The Navy says two of the four American sailors aboard the French nuclear-powered aircraft carrier FS Charles de Gaulle have tested positive for COVID-19.

The Navy says the two are being treated at French facilities. The four U.S. sailors are part of a U.S. Navy exchange program with the French Navy.

The aircraft carrier returned to a French port several days ago with dozens of sailors showing symptoms of coronavirus.

LONDON – At 106, Connie Titchen feels lucky. The former department store sales assistant is Britain’s oldest known survivor of COVID-19.

Titchen was applauded by staff Tuesday at Birmingham’s City Hospital, leaving after three weeks as a patient.

In a statement released by the hospital, Titchen says “I feel very lucky that I’ve fought off this virus. I can’t wait to see my family.”

Granddaughter Alex Jones says Titchen “has had a really active life” and remains independent. She says her grandmother still cooked for herself but also enjoyed a trip to McDonald’s every now and then.

“I haven’t told her they are closed,” she added.

The British government said Wednesday that 12,868 people have died in U.K. hospitals after testing positive for coronavirus, up 761 from the day before. The figure doesn’t include deaths in nursing homes and other settings.

BERLIN — Some German lawmakers are calling on other Western countries to fill the funding gap left by U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to stop payments to the World Health Organization.

Conservative lawmaker Norbert Roettgen told daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung that European Union members and Britain should make up the shortfall.

But Roettgen, a member of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s party who chairs Parliament’s foreign policy committee, echoed Trump’s claim that the WHO had made mistakes in its response to the coronavirus pandemic.

Separately, a leading member of the opposition Free Democratic Party called on the German government and other European countries to bridge WHO’s funding gap.

Alexander Graf Lambsdorff told German news agency dpa the WHO work will be required, particularly in poor countries.

Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Adebahr noted that Germany has already given WHO an additional 5 million euros to tackle the outbreak, but would consider additional support as part of the U.N.’s overall funding request for the pandemic.

MOSCOW — Russian veterans’ groups have asked President Vladimir Putin to postpone the upcoming elaborate Red Square parade that commemorates the defeat of Nazi Germany.

The parade on May 9 is the 75th anniversary of the victory. But the prohibition of mass gatherings to slow the spread of coronavirus has thrown the parade’s future into doubt.

A letter to Putin from veterans’ groups reported Wednesday by Russian news agencies called for postponement to a date “when, in accordance with the epidemiological situation, the parade will not be a threat, but truly a triumph of peace and security for all its participants.”

117,117,https://www.cherokeescout.com/local-news/virus-reaches-nursing-home,"Virus reaches nursing home | Cherokee Scout, Murphy, North Carolina",Andrews – Valley View Care & Rehabilitation Center residents and staff were all tested Monday after one resident came back positive for COVID-19.,www.cherokeescout.com,"Andrews – Valley View Care & Rehabilitation Center residents and staff were all tested Monday after one resident came back positive for COVID-19. On Thursday morning, the Cherokee County Health Department confirmed that all 114 tests returned negative, and there were no other cases at the facility at this time.

 This was Cherokee County’s first case in a long-term care facility. Health Director David Badger said the individual was not showing signs of any symptoms of the virus and is doing well as far as he knew.

 Mark Chandross, administrator of Valley View, said the facility contacted the family members of all residents.

 “That was one of the very first things we did,” he said.

 The individual left the facility for medical care and upon returning to the facility was isolated, as is the facility’s procedure. The health department believes the individual may have been infected while receiving care outside the facility, and that possible exposure prompted testing. Valley View started prohibiting visitors on March 12, ahead of many other facilities.

 Badger said Valley View has been working closely with the health department to protect its residents and staff. Any resident who leaves the facility and returns is quarantined for 14 days, like local governments are asking part-time residents to do.

 “They have been proactive about this,” Badger said.

 Badger said this case is very concerning to him because of the high-risk population in the facility. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control & Prevention list people ages 65 and older, especially those who live in a nursing home or long-term care facility, as high risk for severe illness from COVID-19.

 Valley View is a 76-bed skilled nursing center owned by Consulate Health Care, with about 48 residents and 75 staff members. Chandross said the center has been following all policies set for the coronavirus and practicing safety every day.

 “As it has progressed, we have gotten updates and made changes,” he said. “We’ve got to take care of the staff. We’ve got to take care of our residents. That’s our job.”

 Chandross added he is thankful for the support from the community, which he knows will help them get through this.

 “We’re in this together,” he said.

 In nursing homes across the state, there are 905 cases of COVID-19 and 37 outbreaks. A facility is considered to have an outbreak when it has two or more laboratory-confirmed cases of the virus.

 While those ages 25-49 account for the most confirmed cases in the state, those ages 65 and up account for the most deaths of all age groups at 85 percent. Of the deaths of people who tested positive in the state, 29 percent were nursing home residents as of Monday.

 Last week, the Clay County Care Center had a staff member who felt sick, but tested negative for COVID-19 after taking a rapid test at Erlanger Western Carolina Hospital, the Clay County Health Department said in a release. However, the physicians decided to treat the staff member as a presumptive positive until a confirmatory test could provide results, and everyone at the nursing home was tested. Two days later, the health department announced that all 178 tests from the care center returned negative.

 As of Thursday morning, the Cherokee County Health Department has announced 22 total cases of COVID-19 since March 18. Out of those cases, two were non-residents, one has died and 11 have recovered. Two cases were announced last week, while another one was announced Monday afternoon.

 On the morning of April 18, the health department announced a person was tested after going to a local emergency room for a respiratory-type illness. The person has been isolated since being tested and is isolated in their home, the health department said. This individual had no known contact with anyone infected with the virus.

 On Thursday morning, the health department announced a resident who was exposed to the virus while on essential work-related travel in New Jersey tested positive. The individual has remained isolated in their home since returning to Cherokee County.

 On Monday, a local resident who went to an emergency department in Georgia tested positive there. The person was isolated at a hospital there, and the health department is working to determine where the individual may have been exposed to the virus.

 The health department announced on April 12 that community spread is occurring in the county. Badger said none of the previously reported cases of unknown origin have been connected to any new cases. He added that so far, no cases have been connected to the Lowe’s employee who tested positive two weeks ago.

 Local residents are reminded to continue practicing measures to prevent spreading the virus, like washing hands, coughing or sneezing into the elbow, staying home if sick and social distancing. In instances where social distancing is difficult, the CDC recommends wearing a cloth face covering. Close contact is defined as being within 6 feet of another person for 10 minutes or more. The health department also advises that people continue to follow the state’s Stay-at-Home order.

 As of Monday, North Carolina had 6,764 positive cases of COVID-19 and 179 deaths since the beginning of March. The state is not reporting recoveries, but does not take recoveries away from its total number of cases as it does with deaths."

The package will consist of equity from Germany’s new economic stabilisation fund (ESF), state-guaranteed loans from Germany and debt supplied by Austria, Switzerland and Belgium, where Lufthansa subsidiaries are based, they added.

Lufthansa is in intensive negotiations with the governments regarding various financing instruments to secure the group’s solvency in the near future, Lufthansa said as it reported a first-quarter loss of 1.2 billion euros late on Thursday.

The company declined to comment further and the German government declined to comment.

Chief Executive Carsten Spohr this month said that Lufthansa would seek state aid in Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Belgium, citing cash burn at a rate of 1 million euros per hour, meaning its 4 billion euro cash reserves will be inadequate.

The equity injection from the ESF - possibly up to 4 billion euros - could initially come as a non-voting form of capital dubbed “silent participation”, two of the sources said, adding that some or all could be converted into shares at a later stage.

Roughly 5 billion euros in loans, 80% guaranteed by German state bank KfW, could be part of the package, they said, adding that Austria, Switzerland and Belgium could contribute a combined 1 billion to 1.5 billion euros.

The three countries are pushing for their individual hubs to be strengthened if they participate in the rescue.

“The exact portions of the differents pots of money are still in flux,” another source close to the matter said.

The German government is expected to present its proposal to Lufthansa this week, with talks to be finalised next week, the sources said, adding that it is sure to include fresh equity.

Lufthansa currently has a market capitalisation of 3.8 billion euros and its shareholders would need to approve any large capital increase.

A potential relaxation of refund rules for airlines is not taken into account in the package, the sources said, because an EU decision on any changes to the existing regulations is not expected in the short term.

The German group’s rivals, including Air France-KLM, IAG and easyJet, have also ground to a halt in the face of the pandemic and are expected to receive state support.

Lufthansa, which owns Swiss International, Austrian Airlines and Brussels Airlines, is working with Goldman Sachs as its lead adviser, while Deutsche Bank is its main financing partner, the sources said.

Austria, which has said Lufthansa can apply for state aid, declined to comment. The Swiss government said that no decision has been taken and communication on the matter would take place at the end of the month. The Belgian finance ministry declined to comment on Belgium’s plans."

We have been making adjustments almost daily to ensure our students receive the best education possible, while accepting that circumstances are far from ideal. In midst of this crisis, we need to demonstrate sensitivity and compassion, which are more important than any academic content.

We realize and acknowledge that some students are experiencing high levels of anxiety. They miss the social interaction with their teachers and classmates. They miss the joy generated by extra-curricular activities and the camaraderie of being with their friends and classmates.

At a basic level, students are grieving over the loss of their final drama production, sports season, proms, end of year celebrations, and for some, culminating events such as senior projects and graduation ceremonies. Students feel they’ve been robbed of the experiences, interactions and relationships that are integral to their teenage years.

This month I will offer some suggestions to help relieve the emotional distress that many of our students are experiencing while sheltering in place.

The conditions and characteristics of the pandemic change constantly, as do our emotions and reactions. This problem is uniquely different from general teenage angst. Students have been torn away from those who enrich their personal lives, listen to their woes, help them with academic goals and promote self-advocacy.

Please visit http://www.njuhsd.com/Our-District/Superintendent/COVID-19-Updates/index.html, where you will find a video message from me, information about the new grading policy, and a variety of other COVID-19-related resources.

As the pandemic continues to test our resolve, people may feel severe isolation, loss of self-worth, hopelessness and depression. Parents should monitor their students, and students should check-in with friends. Be on the lookout for:
• Expressions of hopelessness, or desire to hurt themselves

While everyone feels those things from time to time, it is the increase in occurrence and severity that should trigger alarms.

It’s important to know we are not helpless. We can always choose our response. Here are some ways we can take care of our mental health when faced with uncertainty and stress.

Recognize those things that are within your control and which are not. How much news you take in is a good example of this.

Do what helps you feel safe.

Stay in the present. Avoid compounding your worry by projecting the future.

Spend time outside while adhering to social distancing. Fresh air, sunshine, and exercise are important elements of physical and mental well-being.

Here are two websites that contain even more helpful information: http://www.leftbrainbuddha.com/mindfulness-for-teens and http://www.covid19k12counseling.org/help-%2F-hotlines.

A note to our parents: Dealing 24/7 in confined spaces not only as a parent but as a playmate, teacher and caregiver can be intimidating and overwhelming. Loving your children may be a given, but total confinement puts a new spin on patience.

Additional complications include the adult stressors of possible or confirmed unemployment, and the resulting loss of income for food, housing and other necessities. While we may not all share the same situation, we do share the apprehension over new unknowns and uncertainty about how to deal with them.

Here is something you can definitely count on. During the crisis, our district will continue to distribute meals to our students and families every Tuesday 11:30 a.m, – 1 p.m. at Nevada Union and Bear River High Schools. Each distribution contains five breakfast and five lunch meals. We want to thank the United Way and the Food Bank for partnering with us in this effort.

Our high school district counselors, intervention specialists, and mental health therapists are available by telephone and online. Reach out. Don’t delay if you suspect a problem is intensifying. Seeking help is not a sign of weakness. It is a sign of courage.

We are Nevada County strong! We will get through this by supporting and caring for one another.

• Florida's unemployment fund has grown by $13.7 million in April
• NY, Calif. asking feds for $4B interest-free loan to help cover payouts

Florida Department of Economic Opportunity said it has distributed $125 million to 94,909 people who have filed claims for unemployment benefits between March 15, 2020 and April 20, 2020.

That is a 14.2% payout rate on the more than 668,000 people who have applied for benefits in the same period of time.

Florida has one of the stingiest levels of benefits nationally, $275 per week for 12 weeks.

Those state benefits come out of an unemployment trust fund.

According to data from the U.S. Department of Treasury, Florida ran through the month of March 2020 by adding $3 million to the fund , ending March with $4,076,442,840 in total funding.

In April so far, the state of Florida’s account has grown by another $13.7 million, where as some would expect the funding to decrease as benefits are paid out.

A review of the Treasury Department records shows Florida’s unemployment trust fund was at $4,076,442,840 at the start of April, and through April 16, 2020 it grew to $4,090,236,866.

The added revenue is likely from companies who are continuing to pay unemployment insurance.

Overall more than 22 million Americans have filed for unemployment since March.

The states of New York and California report they have seen 1.2 million claims and 2.7 million claims respectively.

The state of New York is asking the federal government for a $4 billion interest free loan to help cover payouts of those claims.

Treasury Department data shows California started April 2020 with $2.1 billion in their unemployment trust fund, which dwindled to $1.8 billion by April 16, the last date of available data.

New York’s unemployment trust fund went from $2.1 billion on April 1 to $1.2 billion on April 16."

CHP citations jump by 87% for violators speeding more than 100 mph

SACRAMENTO, Calif – Caltrans announced today a joint effort with the California Highway Patrol (CHP) and the California Office of Traffic Safety (OTS) to urge drivers in the state to slow down given a recent 87% increase in citations for speeding in excess of 100 mph that coincides with decreased traffic volumes during the COVID-19 pandemic.

From March 19 when the state’s stay-at-home order began to April 19, the CHP reports issuing

2,493 citations statewide for speeding more than 100 mph, as compared to 1,335 during the same period last year. This increase in citations occurred as Caltrans has measured an average decline in traffic volume on state roads of approximately 35% as compared to this time last year.

“Excessive speed and unsafe driving threaten everyone using our highway system,” said Caltrans Director Toks Omishakin. “Viewing less congested roads as an invitation to drive dangerously jeopardizes the safety of construction and maintenance crews who are working to maintain reliable access to our highways when people need it most.”

“It is alarming to see the number of citations officers are writing for excessive speeds on California roadways,” said CHP Commissioner Warren Stanley. “Higher speeds can lead to much more serious injuries and significantly increase the chance of death should a crash occur. Keep yourself and those on the road around you safe. Slow down and drive at a safe, legal speed.”

California’s “Move Over” law continues to be in effect and requires all drivers to move over a lane or, if unable to do so safely, slow down when they see amber flashing lights on Caltrans vehicles, law enforcement and emergency vehicles, and tow trucks.

“Fewer cars on the road doesn’t give drivers the green light to travel over the speed limit,” OTS Director Barbara Rooney said. “Driving at a safe speed when you must go out is one way to keep you and your family safe during this pandemic.”

California’s more than 700 electronic highway signs will also soon display the following types of safety-related messages:

IF YOU MUST TRAVEL DO NOT SPEED – KEEP ESSENTIAL WORKERS SAFE DO NOT SPEED

During the COVID-19 emergency, Caltrans continues to provide the general public with a safe and reliable transportation system. The department is maintaining all critical functions during this crisis, including ensuring roadway access to medical facilities and the convenient transport of essential goods and services throughout the state. Some non-essential work has been deferred to limit spread of the COVID-19 virus, but maintenance and construction crews are still addressing hazards, safety concerns and other critical functions on the highways.

Why it’s important: Fire Chief Dave Keens said the Pierce Enforcer pumper will be primarily equipped as a structural engine, first due on most incidents with a turning radius and height requirement necessary to accommodate the fast-growing suburban community east of Lancaster.

Financing: The fire company is financing the vehicle through a combination of savings, grants, a state loan and $358,000 from the township.

What’s next: Lafayette expects to take delivery of pumper by the middle of 2021. Pierce still has to build the new pumper, which takes 12 months once a contract is signed.

Economic challenges: Township Manager Ralph Hutchison said he has been meeting with department heads to review the budget to determine revenue impacts from the coronavirus crisis. He said in May he should know how much has been collected from real estate taxes. He said the earned income tax, local services tax and admissions tax have been hit the hardest from the pandemic, with Dutch Wonderland amusement park being the highest generator of the admissions tax.

Stevens Tech expansion: The township signed a developer’s agreement with High Associates for an 86,000-square-foot building to be used for Thaddeus Stevens College of Technology’s automotive technology and collision repair programs. The plan is to build the facility along a new road, Ben Franklin Boulevard, that runs through a northern section of Greenfield Corporate Center. The boulevard will connect Willow Road with extension of Walnut Street that is proposed on an abandoned highway, the so-called “goat path,” north of Route 30.

Rockvale plan: The board accepted a proposed zoning amendment for review from Rockvale outlets to convert the shopping center to a mixed-use property of housing and offices, using a commercial redevelopment overlay zone.

What’s next: Neighboring municipalities, as well as Conestoga Valley School District and Lancaster County Planning Commission, will have 45 days to review the plan prior to a public hearing held by East Lampeter officials. The next supervisors meeting will be at 7:30 p.m. May 18."

Dr Tengku Ahmad Damitri said that besides the face shields, Papisma was also producing hand sanitiser and personal protective equipment (PPE) suits.

“The hand sanitiser is made using alcohol and distilled water.

“Our members also include pharmacists who have knowledge on producing hand sanitiser the correct way.

“As for the PPE, we are collaborating with 30 tailors who are able to sew about 30 sets of PPE daily.

“I have ordered our naval forces to destroy any American terrorist force in the Persian Gulf that threatens security of Iran’s military or non-military ships,” Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) Gen. Hossein Salami said on state television, as reported by Reuters.

Salami added that Iran will ensure security in the Persian Gulf as one of its top priorities.

“I am telling the Americans that we are absolutely determined and serious in defending our national security, our water borders, our shipping safety, and our security forces, and we will respond decisively to any sabotage,” Salami continued.

“Americans have experienced our power in the past and must learn from it,” he added.

President Donald Trump had revealed in a tweet on Wednesday morning that he granted the U.S. Navy permission to shoot down Iranian gunboats who harass U.S. ships.

“I have instructed the United States Navy to shoot down and destroy any and all Iranian gunboats if they harass our ships at sea,” Trump tweeted.

Trump doubled down on his order during the White House coronavirus press briefing on Wednesday evening.

“We don’t want their gunboats around our boats,” Trump said. “We’re not going to stand for it.”

Trump said he would not allow Iran to continue to harass U.S. ships without repercussions, adding that the U.S. Navy will “shoot them out of the water.”

In a Wednesday night interview with Fox News’ Martha McCallum, Defense Secretary Mark Esper said he and Trump discussed the shootdown order together ahead of time.

“We are looking at making modifications to our practices to make sure the Iranians know to stay clear of our warships and our personnel,” he said. “We are not going to tolerate threatening behavior toward our warships.

“It’s unprofessional, it’s provocative, and it puts our warships and our sailors at risk,” Esper said of Iran’s recent harassment of U.S. ships. “They need to stay clear of United States warships wherever they may be operating.”

Deputy Secretary of Defense David Norquist also reaffirmed Trump’s message during a Pentagon press conference late Wednesday morning.

“All of our ships retain the right of self-defense and people need to be very careful in their interactions to understand the right of self-defense,” Norquist said.

Joint Staff Vice Chairman, Air Force Gen. John Hyten added, “Every capability that we deploy – every ship that deploys into harm’s way – has the inherent right of self-defense.”

“If we see a hostile act, if we see hostile intent, we have the right to respond up to and including lethal force. If it happens in the Gulf, if it happens in any way, we will respond with overwhelming lethal force if necessary to defend ourselves. It’s really that simple,” Hyten continued.

Hyten warned that no adversary should doubt the U.S. ability to respond to provocation at this time.

“I like that the president warned an adversary. That’s what he’s doing – he’s providing a warning,” said Hyten. “‘If you want to go down that path, we will come, and we will come large, so don’t go down that path.’ That is what he’s saying. He’s saying it in clear, certain terms. We understand that direction and every commander that’s deployed has the ability to execute that.”

“If you come across and you’re in a safe distance and you’re waving, that’s one thing. If you have a gun and you point it at me, that’s another thing. We know exactly what that means. If you cross that line – we know what that line is – and we will respond,” Hyten continued. “We don’t need any more direction in order to do that. I think the President’s message was crystal clear.”

Trump’s directive comes a week after 11 Iranian gunboats harassed six U.S. warships conducting joint operations in international waters of the Arabian Gulf.

USS Lewis B. Puller (ESB 3), USS Paul Hamilton (DDG 60), USS Firebolt (PC 10), USS Sirocco (PC 6), USCGC Wrangell (WPB 1332) and USCGC Maui (WPB 1304) were conducting joint operations along with U.S. Army AH-64E Apache helicopters when the encounter occurred.

The Iranian vessels came within 10 yards of USCGC Maui’s bow, and 50 yards from USS Lewis B. Puller. U.S. ships were forced to take action to avoid colliding with Iranian boats.

U.S. crews issued radio warnings, five blasts from ships’ horns, and sounded acoustic noise makers, but were ignored by Iranian crews.

After an hour, Iranian crews finally responded and turned away from the U.S. warships.

“The IRGCN’s dangerous and provocative actions increased the risk of miscalculation and collision, were not in accordance with the internationally recognized Convention on the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGS) ‘rules of the road’ or internationally recognized maritime customs, and were not in accordance with the obligation under international law to act with due regard for the safety of other vessels in the area,” U.S. Naval Forces Central Command said in a statement.

The Iranian military acknowledged the close encounter with the U.S. Navy, but claimed the U.S. gave a false account of the incident.

“We advise Americans to follow international regulations and maritime protocols in the Persian Gulf and Sea of Oman, and avoid any adventurism and false stories,” the IRGC said in a statement.

In an announcement appearing to be aimed at the U.S. Navy, Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) paramilitary force said on Monday that it now has anti-ship missiles capable of reaching targets up to 430 miles away."
130,130,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/black-bear-rescue-2-new-tiny-cubs-1.5542052,Stonewall bear rescue takes care of highest number of cubs in its history | News,Black Bear Rescue Manitoba is caring for eight cubs after taking in another pair last week.,www.cbc.ca,"There's Izzy, Juniper, Jolene, Jasper, Karla, Koda and two yet-to-be-named bear cubs.

They've all been taken in recently by Black Bear Rescue Manitoba, which is caring for the highest number of cubs in its history after taking in another pair last week.

The rescue, located near Stonewall, Man., takes in orphaned cubs, rehabilitates them and prepares them for a fall release.

Last year, Judy and Roger Stearns — the Stonewall couple who care for the bears and are co-founders of the rescue —looked after seven cubs with the help of volunteers.

This year, they already have eight in their care, including two taken in last week by Manitoba conservation officers.

The cubs were spotted by a landowner in a field near Minnedosa, with ravens circling overhead and a missing mother who did not return, said Julie Woodyer, the spokesperson for Black Bear Rescue Manitoba.

The cubs are still pretty tiny, each weighing less than seven pounds, she said, but are in good health.

""They're quite assertive, these ones, because they were already out of the den and had some time with their mom, unlike some of the previous ones that we got,"" Woodyer said.

The rescue also took in a pair of cubs at the end of March, after their den was destroyed by a piece of heavy equipment. Their mother and a sibling were killed, Woodyer said.

Those two are Karla and Koda.

""I think that's one message I'd like to get out there is that sometimes bears will actually den very near the surface or just underneath the snow,"" she said.

""It's very easy to disturb, to disrupt them at that time of year.""

The cubs that come in together tend to stick together at first, but eventually, once they get to know each other and are old enough to be let into the rescue's outdoor enclosure, they all start to play together, Woodyer said.

""That's a really exciting time, because they get out there and they start climbing and just investigating all the different areas,"" she said.

""And that's when we start hiding food around the enclosure so that they get into every little nook and cranny and start to learn some of the skills they're going to need to forage when they get back to the wild.""

Right now, the rescue has a fundraiser called 30 Smiles for $30. The campaign encourages people to make a $30 donation to the rescue, which promised at the beginning of April to post a daily picture of the cubs over a 30-day period."

Welcome to the Second Annual Grade the Vikings Draft BEFORE the Draft!
 ...",www.dailynorseman.com,"This is the continuation of a tradition that began way back last year and, in time honored fashion, will continue now.

Welcome to the Second Annual Grade the Vikings Draft BEFORE the Draft!

There are only just so many players the Vikings could select in Rd 1 so, all we have to do, we just give a grade to each if they were to be picked. We commit to it thus justifying future second guessing or pre-endorsing picks. Also, it is a chance to effect the draft. Last year I happen to know -- well, maybe not know know but, it is pretty obvious it happened -- that Trader Rick, just before the draft, read my post, saw my A+ grade were the Vikings to draft Garrett Bradbury, and, voila, Bob's your uncle, he went and selected Garrett Bradbury.

Before you ask, no, that is not me. He is supposedly saying ""Bob's my uncle"" according to the internet but we all know the internet is a lying scoundrel. I don't know. Maybe he's saying it in Portuguese? Just pretend that is what he's saying.

Neither you nor I have time for why each player is in each grade category. I'm just going to throw them out there. My disclaimer is that some Rd 1 F grades would be A grades in Rd 2 so I am obviously not saying they will never do anything in the NFL. Our needs are fairly clear-cut = Corner, Wide Receiver, OT, OG, DE, DT. No one other than those should be taken by us in Rd 1. If we take a QB, LB, TE, or RB, we deserve an F. That F is for the organization, not that particular player.

We'll build up to the best....

Yes, I know some of these guys no on thinks will go in Rd 1 and I'm not saying they will. But you can use the grades as a reference in Rd 2. Most the A guys will be scooped up before our picks. ""A"" guys are worth trading up for but lower them one level if we give up a 3rd and 2 levels if we give up a 2nd. Trading a #1 and our 2nd to move up to get Lamb? Fine, but I give that a C. I'd much rather have Reagor and that 2nd. Of the ten A players, I expect at least 6 and maybe 8 to be gone by our picks. CB is our biggest need but talent evaporates at the position. The fastest most athletic guys just naturally get placed as WRs and the dregs become CBs. We have a good chance of getting one of the WRs in my A list and one of the OTs. The problem with that is both classes are deeper and we can get good players later. A note on consistency: I do adore Terrell Lewis (is ""adore"" the proper word?) but half the teams have failed him physically. I really have no idea about this. Teams failed Adrian Peterson also! And Curtis Martin was supposed to be limited to a 4 or 5 year career but went on to become one of the all time leaders in rushing yardage. If not for the physical doubt then I'd consider Lewis an A pick. Another note to clarify. B is really good. B is not average. C is average. Here is a happy face line up so you can understand better....

If the Vikings take an A player:

If the Vikings take a B player:

If the Vikings take a C player:

If the Vikings take a D player:

If the Vikings take an F player:

That one is also called ""The Christian Ponder""....

I still remember that draft. I was traveling and in a hotel room. All alone. Looking forward to getting Robert Quinn with our pick. Then... suddenly... I was somehow even more alone. The world seemed to spin. When awareness returned to me I found myself kneeling on the crusty hotel carpet with head bowed in draft shame.

Come on Trader Rick! Don't do us wrong!

Make us feel like this ="

136,136,https://hungarytoday.hu/coronavirus-hungary-restrictions-hospital-beds/,"Coronavirus - Gov't: Restrictions to be Extended until May 3, Easing Too Early",Read here the latest news about Hungary,hungarytoday.hu,"The government is extending the timeframe of restrictions on movement introduced to combat the novel coronavirus epidemic until May 3, the head of the Prime Minister’s Office said on his weekly presser on Thursday.

Gergely Gulyás said the government believes it is “too early” to start easing certain restrictions as other countries have, such as sending children back to school. However, the health-care sector is now at a level of preparedness that will allow for a gradual reopening of the economy under a strict schedule, he added.

The PM’s Office chief said May 3 was the earliest projected date for the virus to peak and that the health authorities would have to apply the strictest possible protective measures at that point. He added, however, that it was impossible to predict the exact day on which the virus would peak, underlining the need for constant preparedness over the coming weeks. Gulyás said it would take weeks after the peak to level off, and modelling indicated that it would recede in waves.

Hungary is keeping an eye on international epidemic response practices, mainly those implemented in Germany and Austria, Gulyás added. Until a vaccine is developed, “we will have to live with the virus in one way or another”, he said, adding that virologists expected a second wave to appear in September-October.

Answering a question on making wearing face masks compulsory, Gulyás said it was up to the operative board to make such a decision. Compulsory face coverings are ordered for the most part in enclosed spaces such as shops and public transport in other countries, he noted.

The head of the Prime Minister’s Office praised the work of Human Resources Minister Miklós Kásler and Chief Medical Officer Cecília Müller, saying that the health-care system was prepared to handle a “crisis bigger than ever”.

He thanked those who had contributed to getting Hungary’s health-care system ready to cope with the epidemic, adding that the time left until May 3 would be enough to prepare for a massive increase in infections.

He said the decision to order hospitals to vacate 50 percent of their beds and have 8,000 functioning ventilators ready had been a “strictly a professional one”, as the government wants to be prepared for a worst-case scenario.

Regarding accepting gravely ill coronavirus patients from other countries, Gulyás said there were no such plans as yet. Hungary will be happy to help others once it is in a position to do so without endangering its own citizens’ security and health, he said.

Commenting on the quality of available protective gear, Gulyás said most items suited their purpose. He added that some 2 percent of masks have been forwarded to ethnic Hungarians beyond the borders and to other countries.

He said he was unable to provide an exact figure concerning the level of infections among health staff. He added, however, that the Hungarian average was in line with international figures, or around 10 percent.

Gulyás said a debate on whether the current hospital financing model was useful should be held only after the epidemic is over.

137,137,https://www.sfchronicle.com/food/article/Bay-Area-direct-trade-spice-companies-bring-15219598.php,"Bay Area direct-trade spice companies bring equity, fresh spices into the kitchen","Direct-trade spice companies such as Burlap &amp; Barrel, Diaspora Co. and Noble House Spice prioritize flavor over profits, paying spice farmers around the world far more than the commodity market.",www.sfchronicle.com,"In the Bay Area, restaurant chefs and home cooks alike are known for caring about where their food comes from. They can name the ranch that raised their pork, the farm that grew their salad greens. But what about their spices?

For many, spices are colorful powders that come from somewhere.

“Coffee used to just be black coffee. Now people are like, ‘I want a Guatemalan, shade-grown medium roast,’” said Ori Zohar, who co-founded single-origin spice company Burlap & Barrel in San Francisco. “There’s beauty in a transparent supply chain, and it just hasn’t happened with spices.”

But that’s starting to change — and fast. A number of direct-trade spice companies have emerged across the country over the past few years, prioritizing flavor and equity over profits. These companies are traveling to spice farms in India, Vietnam and Afghanistan, finding ambitious farmers growing a superior product and paying them as much as 10 times more than the commodity market. Three of these spice companies are in the Bay Area — a fitting extension of the region’s farm-to-table mentality.

These entrepreneurs say the spice trade hasn’t changed much since the imperialist days of Dutch ships crossing the globe, though it’s not as bloody anymore. What remains is a complex system of multiple traders, exporters and importers, with spices trading hands anywhere from five to 20 times between the farmer and the retailer. The middlemen tend to make the most money, with farmers getting pennies on the dollar.

Cutting out these middlemen is the goal of companies such as Diaspora Co. in Oakland, Noble House Spice in San Rafael and Burlap & Barrel. While Noble House is a wholesaler, Diaspora and Burlap & Barrel primarily sell directly to home cooks.

“It’s taken the rise of global travel, ease of movement, ease of trade across borders — there have been a lot of things that have come together to make it possible to run a specialty food business and build a farm-to-table supply chain globally,” said Sana Javeri Kadri, founder of Diaspora Co.

Bay Area spice entrepreneurs also cite technology, such as WhatsApp and Google Translate, as key developments allowing relationships with farmers overseas to thrive. But that doesn’t answer the question of why this ethical spice industry took so long to begin compared to fair-trade chocolate and coffee companies, which are now widespread.

Spices are a lot more complicated — it’s hundreds of crops instead of one like cacao, said John Beaver, owner of Oaktown Spice Shop, which stocks single-origin spices at its stores in Oakland and Albany.

“It’s a bigger field but it’s not a bigger market,” Beaver said. “Even if you were to do just peppercorns, you could do dozens of different kinds of peppercorns.”

The overwhelming nature of spices caused Javeri Kadri to start small. Frustrated by the explosive popularity of turmeric in the Bay Area due to wellness gurus like Gwyneth Paltrow who disregarded its historical and cultural uses in India, the former Bi-Rite Market employee booked a one-way ticket to her native Mumbai to immerse herself in turmeric in its appropriate context.

She showed up at the Indian Institute of Spices Research, looking to learn about different strains of turmeric and find the very best. She returned to Oakland, and in 2017 launched Diaspora Co., , where her first harvest of turmeric — vividly colored, unusually earthy and balanced with buttery notes — sold out in about three hours. While the commodity market price for 1 kilogram of turmeric in India was about 35 cents, Javeri Kadri paid $3.50 per kilo.

“The fact that people are willing to go to an obscure website to buy one thing for their pantry they use once a month, I was surprised,” she said with a laugh.

That trend has continued, even as she’s slowly brought on new spices like heirloom cardamom and chiles. She thought her last black pepper harvest would last seven or eight months; it sold out in three.

Noble House also launched in 2017, an effort from three Bay Area-born siblings and one of their husbands, a chef who has worked in Michelin-starred restaurants. In a sense, it’s an extension of their parents’ nonprofit, Roots of Peace, which has focused on agricultural development to rebuild communities in Vietnam and Afghanistan.

“We were raised in a way that social impact is just what we have to do. It’s part of our DNA,” said Noble House’s Kyleigh Kuhn.

Noble House zeroes in on women and other marginalized farmers, working with them to develop new practices and walking them through paperwork. Most recently, they started collaborating with a group in Syria to bring true Aleppo pepper to the U.S., which is tricky when the region is in conflict. They have to route the pepper to a neighboring country first to pass through customs.

“It’s a complicated process. For anyone not used to doing it, it’s an impossible task,” said Tucker Kuhn, Kyleigh’s brother. “It probably doesn’t make too much sense in terms of the investment and time, but it’s a passion.”

Burlap & Barrel, meanwhile, has a classic Bay Area origin story. Zohar moved to San Francisco to launch a mortgage startup several years ago. Venture-backed and fast-tracked, it quickly grew to 100 employees. But due to a predatory investor, Zohar said he had to shrink the company and rapidly sell in 2017.

Around the same time, he heard from an old chef friend in New York, Ethan Frisch, who wanted Zohar’s entrepreneurial perspective on some spices he’d picked up while living in Afghanistan. Frisch flew out to San Francisco, and Zohar remembers setting up a meeting at one of the city’s top restaurants, fanning out little unmarked baggies of spices, including black cumin seeds so tiny you don’t even need to toast or grind them, foraged in the mountains.

“We realized that if chefs who have access to all the best ingredients in the world were getting so excited about spices that he had brought back in his checked bags, then there was a real business here,” Zohar said.

With Burlap & Barrel, their plan was to boot-strap and slowly build relationships; they now work with farmers in 12 countries.

What comes out of these relationships are better spices than the stuff you find in most grocery stores. They’re fresher, brighter, with aromas so intense that Zohar recommends home cooks start with half the amount of spice a recipe calls for.

Some highlights from Burlap & Barrel include those black cumin seeds Frisch brought back from Afghanistan and Turkish oregano buds to use in place of the more common leaves, tiny little flowers with a slightly bitter edge. And there are harder-to-find spices, too, like Turkish black Urfa, a chile that’s fermented until it beckons with flavors of raisin, molasses and tobacco.

Certainly, they’re more expensive than conventional spices — a small jar of organic ground cumin at Safeway runs $4.99, while the same size jar of Burlap & Barrel’s foraged cumin costs $9.99. Single-orgin spice companies tend to rebuke fair-trade certification because the process costs money, and they’d rather that money go to farmers, said Beaver.

Noble House’s most popular product is a late-harvest pepper from Vietnam. While most farmers harvest black pepper early to protect it from winds and birds, these farmers leave it for weeks longer so it turns burgundy in color and develops natural sugars.

“It’s like a green banana versus a ripened banana,” said Kyleigh Kuhn. “It’s beautifully expressed, more floral, much more sweet.”

Diaspora rose to national prominence because of the quality of its turmeric, but the flavor alone isn’t what made it so successful. Javeri Kadri’s story as someone who didn’t feel represented in the food industry drew in diverse members of the diaspora community at large.

“Somehow a jar of really beautiful spices can help them feel seen,” she said.

With home cooks playing around in their kitchens and digging through their cupboards during the coronavirus, these companies are still in pretty good shape. While Burlap & Barrel sold to restaurants and some small specialty markets, 50% of business was home cooks ordering off its website — and that side of the business has skyrocketed during the pandemic.

But the coronavirus threatens international supply chains — even extremely short ones. Burlap & Barrel is still waiting on shipments in Guatemala, Vietnam and India, with no indication of when they’ll arrive. India is particularly concerning since it’s on a complete lockdown until at least May 3.

“We’re really nervous a shipment of our product will not leave the country or not be accepted in America and just be stuck on the water,” Zohar said.

Diaspora works exclusively with farmers in India — Javeri Kadri was actually in the middle of a three-month sourcing trip when the pandemic struck. She left on the second-to-last flight out of India.

This was set to be a big year for Javeri Kadri. On her trip to India, she planned to bring on four more spices and partner with a factory there so she could control sterilization and packaging for all of the farms she buys from in one place. When she got back to Oakland, she planned to open a new warehouse — she currently operates out of her house — that would double as a cafe and retail shop.

Many of those plans are on hold. But the farmers she works with are safe and healthy, and she feels fortunate that 80% of Diaspora’s business was already direct to consumer.

“For a week, I was crushed that my revenue projections and new spice launches were all for naught, but I quickly started to see this tremendous silver lining,” she said.

Basically, she told herself to stop worrying and instead figure out how to be of service to her farmers during the coronavirus. The result was asking customers to preorder spices now, knowing they won’t receive them until India’s lockdown ends. Javeri Kadri was able to pay farmers for the rest of the year and expand health care coverage and insurance to all of Diaspora’s farmers and laborers, with the additional goal of raising $10,000 for an emergency fund for all of the farms to share.

Javeri Kadri hopes to be an example of how things can look in the modern global spice industry.

“The spice trade was always dominated by folks in power. Folks in power weren’t the primary consumers of spice and not the people who really understood the culture and ancient legacy of spice,” she said. “The next wave is cultural ownership and taking back power.”"

Former Taranaki woman Michele Bannister is a 2020 winner of a Zeldovich Medal, awarded to young scientists to recognise their excellence and achievement in the field of space research.

The Zeldovich Medals are conferred by the Russian Academy of Sciences and Committee on Space Research (Cospar), which was established by the International Council for Science in 1958.

The award honours the memory of distinguished astrophysicist academic Yakov B. Zeldovich.

Bannister was shocked when she got the email announcing she had been given the award.

""I was pretty surprised and it came out of the blue for me.""

She does not know who nominated her but considered it an amazing achievement.

""It is an international recognition.""

As a planetary astronomer, the 34-year-old is dedicated to understanding how the solar system was formed and its evolution.

In the course of her work she has collaborated with colleagues in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, the United States and Taiwan on projects.

In 2016, Bannister helped discover a dwarf planet half the size of Britain, in the outer solar system, about nine billion kilometres away on an orbit far beyond the realm of Neptune.

The following year, a 11-kilometre wide rock was bestowed with the moniker Asteroid (10463) Bannister, named after the former Waitara High School dux.

After 12 years living overseas, Bannister returned to New Zealand in February.

She started her job at the School of Physical and Chemical Sciences at the University of Canterbury and begins teaching there from next week.

Bannister said New Zealand had only recently joined Cospar, which was a sign of the country's growing role and interest in space research."

I am convinced of that"" after the president said the virus ""may not come back at all.""",www.jsonline.com,"WASHINGTON – Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, appeared to contradict President Donald Trump's notion that the coronavirus may not reappear for a second wave in the fall.

""It may not come back at all,"" Trump said Wednesday during a White House briefing.

He discussed the return of COVID-19 after quibbling with a report that said CDC Director Robert Redfield warned of a second wave of the coronavirus outbreak in the fall that could be worse because it could coincide with the opening of the flu season.

""He's talking about a worst-case scenario where you have a big flu and you have some (coronavirus). And if it does come back, it's not going to come back ... like it was. Also, we have much better containment now,"" Trump said.

""Before nobody knew about it. Nobody knew anything about it. Now, if we have pockets, a little pocket here or there, we're going to have it put out. It goes out, and it’s going to go out fast. We’re going to be watching for it. But it’s also possible it doesn’t come back at all.""

The president claimed a comeback of coronavirus later in the year will not be ""anything near what we went through,"" regarding the pandemic that is still ongoing.

Trump's comments come as medical experts have warned the country may not return to normal life regarding social distancing until there is a vaccine.

Experts have also assured the public the country will be better prepared to fight a second wave by developing therapeutics and stocking up with equipment, like ventilators.

Fauci, a key member of the White House's Coronavirus Task Force, reiterated this Wednesday.

""We will have coronavirus in the fall,"" he said. ""I am convinced of that because of the degree of transmissibility that it has, the global nature. What happens with that will depend on how we’re able to contain it when it occurs.""

The COVID-19 outbreak has killed nearly 47,000 people in the U.S. and more than 183,000 worldwide, according to the data Wednesday from Johns Hopkins University.

This outbreak became widespread in March when the number of flu cases normally begins to taper off. Redfield warned that if hospitals had to respond to another coronavirus outbreak at the same time as flu cases, both of which affect the respiratory system, the health care system could be overwhelmed."

F,www.dailycall.com,"MIAMI VALLEY — Many current students and alumni of Edison State Community College have been deemed essential in this unprecedented global pandemic. From being employed as registered nurses, phlebotomists, and medical laboratory technicians, to working in the agricultural, grocery store, and foodservice industries, the appreciation for the critical work they’re performing continues to grow exponentially.

While many are working in front line positions, students and alumni of Edison State’s medical laboratory technician (MLT) program are working behind the scenes to perform complex laboratory testing and experimental treatment in internship experiences and on the job.

Payton Amstutz, of Wapakoneta, is an MLT student at Edison State who is currently interning at St. Rita’s Hospital in Lima. Beginning last Wednesday, St. Rita’s went live with COVID-19 testing, giving Amstutz first-hand experience with the testing method.

“Overall, the COVID-19 testing method has been an ever-changing whirlwind. Our policies have been changing not only by the day, but often by the hour. Currently, we are still sending tests out to reference labs and the Ohio Department of Health,” said Amstutz.

Rapid changes to testing methods are not the only challenge healthcare facilities are facing. Access to the reagents, or substances and mixtures used in chemical analysis, needed to perform the testing are also challenging to obtain.

“Our Microbiology team was able to validate a testing method that only takes 15 minutes to run. However, it is very difficult to acquire reagents for the testing as it is in very high demand. The pathologists have decided to conserve our in-house tests as much as possible by only using it for in-patients and employees who were exposed. We are hoping to be able to continue this testing and expand our patient base if the reagents become more readily available,” said Amstutz.

Edison State alumnus Taylor Kolker has been able to apply knowledge from his degree while working for CompuNet Clinical Laboratories in blood transfusion services at Miami Valley Hospital. Kolker, of West Milton, is participating in the experimental treatment of transfusing convalescent plasma to patients suffering from an active viral infection.

Convalescent plasma is a blood product that comes from patients with previously confirmed cases of COVID-19 and can contain antibodies against the A and B antigens found on red blood cells in addition to the antibodies against the virus. So, it’s important that compatible plasma be utilized.

“In a situation like the COVID-19 pandemic, convalescent plasma transfusions are allowing patients to benefit from the immune systems of previously infected donors,” said Kolker. “While this is not the cure to COVID-19, it gives patients in critical condition the best possible chance of overcoming the infection until the development of a vaccine can be completed.”

While the experimental treatment is a work in progress, medical laboratory technicians like Kolker are hopeful it will provide a solution.

“The use of convalescent plasma as a treatment for COVID-19 has been a work in progress the past couple weeks. While convalescent plasma was previously used to treat a variety of conditions (such as Ebola in recent years), it is not a commonly used product in the traditional hospital setting. Because of this, we have been working together closely with the Dayton Community Blood Center, the Miami Valley Hospital research team, the Mayo Clinic, and the FDA in order to establish an appropriate set of protocols for the transfusion of this product,” said Kolker.

“It is not a perfect treatment, and it often works differently depending on the recipient. However, it has shown a great deal of promise with giving patients the edge their immune system needs to fight off the virus more effectively.”

“The world of medicine is still full of questions when it comes to COVID-19, but convalescent plasma transfusions have been a ray of hope for patients and their families in these times of uncertainty, and I am grateful for the opportunity to be a part of it.”

The week of April 19-25, 2020, is recognized as 44th annual Medical Laboratory Professionals Week, which aims to increase public understanding of and appreciation for clinical laboratory personnel."

The new system is to improve",www.finanznachrichten.de,"Olympus Corporation (President: Yasuo Takeuchi) today announced the launch of EVIS X1, its most advanced endoscopy system to date. The new system is to improve outcomes from disorders of the stomach, colon, and oesophagus, as well as from bronchial diseases, by providing every endoscopist with innovative and proven tools. The launch of EVIS X1 further strengthens Olympus' leadership in endoscopy and continued medical focus.

EVIS X1 supports accurate screening and confident diagnosis through introducing new and easy-to-use technologies to support how gastrointestinal disorders, such as colorectal cancer (CRC), or bronchial diseases are detected, characterized and treated. These include Extended Depth of Field (EDOF), Red Dichromatic Imaging (RDI), Texture and Color Enhancement Imaging (TXI) as well as the already known and proven Narrow Band Imaging (NBI). Being committed to innovation, Olympus is also already developing future technologies in particular featuring artificial intelligence (AI).

""EVIS X1 is the latest innovation to build on our 100-year legacy of world-leading innovation and quality,"" said Frank Drewalowski, Head of Endoscopic Solutions Division, Olympus Corporation. ""We are proud that, with EVIS X1, we can support endoscopists around the world and help to elevate the standard of endoscopy across the board.""

The key features of the EVIS X1 system include:
• Extended Depth of Field (EDOF): EDOF combines two images at different focal lengths into one perfect image to help aid diagnosis and confident decision-making. It delivers observational excellence through continuous broad focus and seamless magnification. At the same time, the established Dual Focus function provides high magnification, which can be activated by the push of a button. This improved visibility and continuously sharp image has been developed to reduce the necessity for focal adjustments and could improve efficiency and decrease the oversight rate.
• Red Dichromatic Imaging (RDI): Gastrointestinal bleeding is a serious challenge, potentially involving considerable mortality and management costs. RDI enhances the visibility of deep blood vessels and GI bleeding sources, thereby helping to identify blood vessels that could require immediate treatment. It utilizes green, amber and red wavelengths to visualize deep blood vessels. Easier identification of bleeding spots makes hemostasis quicker and easier whilst potentially improving the efficiency of any corresponding treatment. This minimally invasive technology could also help reduce physician stress during endoscopic therapy.
• Texture and Color Enhancement Imaging (TXI): TXI supports better visibility of potential and extant lesions (such as areas of inflammation, flat or depressed lesions, or even tiny precursor lesions) through enhancing texture, brightness and color to define subtle tissue differences more clearly. With its advanced imaging technology, TXI holds the potential to reinvent white light in endoscopy. By supporting better visibility of potential and extant lesions, TXI aims to contribute to higher detection rates and improve qualitative diagnosis.
• Narrow Band Imaging (NBI): NBI is an already known, powerful and proven optical technology that allows for a high-confidence optical diagnosis through the creation of a strong contrast between vessels and surrounding mucosa. It utilizes specific blue and green wavelengths. NBI not only supports earlier detection of any lesions but also provides a more detailed, higher-contrasted visualization and thus improves qualitative diagnosis.

The next upcoming feature of the EVIS X1 system will be AI. Olympus is developing innovative new ways to integrate breakthroughs in deep learning into the world of image detection, characterization, staging, and treatment.

Beyond introducing new features, EVIS X1 also provides newly established cross-compatibility between two formerly separate systems: EVIS LUCERA ELITE and EVIS EXERA III. This means that Olympus' existing range of products can be combined to provide an extended portfolio of endoscopes for special procedures expanding the possibilities for endoscopists.

Especially by helping to facilitate screening and early detection of abnormalities in the gastrointestinal tract, EVIS X1 could play a major role in the prevention of colorectal cancer (CRC). In 2018, there were 1.80 million cases of colorectal cancer and 862,000 patient deaths worldwide.i It is also expected that the global burden of CRC will increase substantially by 2030.ii For every 1% increase in adenoma detection rate (ADR), there is a 3% decrease in CRC risk.iii

""Early detection and diagnosis is critical for CRC prevention,"" said Prof. Michal F. Kaminski, Professor at the National Research Institute of Oncology in Warsaw. ""EVIS X1 is intuitive and gives endoscopists a range of innovative and proven tools to carry out minimally invasive, precise and effective procedures enabling them to make truly-informed diagnostic and treatment decisions in the best interest of their patients. Among the new technologies especially TXI looks promising. It seems to provide more information to the endoscopist while maintaining a close to white light appearance. This will make it very easy to adapt to it.""

EVIS X1 is not only anticipated to serve healthcare professionals, hospital management and patients around the world but also follows Olympus' implementation of its strategy. ""Our purpose is to make people's lives healthier, safer and more fulfilling,"" said Takaharu Yamada, Vice President, GI Endoscopy Business, Global, Olympus Corporation. ""This launch also strengthens our global leadership in endoscopy and follows our focus of the corporate portfolio centering on the medical business.""

EVIS X1 is initially being launched in EMEA (Europe, Middle East Africa), Australia, India and Hong Kong. It is manufactured by Olympus Medical Systems Corporation. The company and product names specified in this release are the trademarks or registered trademarks of Olympus

Aside the collective donation of salaries to the federal government, some members of the National Assembly have also contributed to COVID-19 response in their respective states as well as providing palliatives to constituents to ease the lockdown effects.

However, even for those that have reached out to their constituents, mixed reactions have trailed what they presented as palliatives.

While some relief items attracted commendations, others are said to be insignificant, with no impact on people’s lives.

In some places, constituents accused lawmakers of handing over the relief items to party members, with the distribution mainly among loyalists in the wards.

In other areas, people spoken to said they only heard of palliatives but did not see any distributed.

Some people spoken to in Sokoto lamented that their lawmakers have abandoned them.

Out of 14 federal lawmakers in the state, only two are said to have provided palliatives to their constituents, our correspondent reports.

Daily Trust gathered that the senator representing Sokoto North, Aliyu Magatakarda Wamakko, reached out to his people with relief items, while Mani Maishinku Katami, who represents Binji-Silame federal constituency, gave cash donation in addition to contribution he made to the state COVID-19 Rapid Response Team, along with three other PDP’s federal lawmakers.

The three lawmakers are Balarabe Kakale, Abu Audu and Muhammad Sa’idu Bargaja.

Daily Trust further gathered that the senator representing Sokoto South zone, Ibrahim Danbaba Dambuwa, supported the state’s coronavirus response team but nothing had been heard about providing palliatives to members of his constituency.

It was same story with three members of the House of Representatives from the zone, Bala Kokani (Kebbe/Tambuwal), Abubakar Umar Yabo (Yabo/Shagari) and Balarabe Kakale (Dange-Shuni/Bodinga/Tureta) respectively.

Similarly, in Sokoto East, constituents said their representative, Engr Ibrahim Gobir, had not been coming to the area even with the frequent bandits’ attacks which have been claiming lives and properties.

The story was not different with the people of Sokoto South/Sokoto North, Tangaza/Gudu, and Kware/Wamakko as they claimed they have received no support from their representatives, Abu Audu, Yusuf Isa Kurdula and Abdullahi Kalambaina, to mitigate their hardships in this trying time.

Daily Trust reliably gathered that some of the lawmakers are in Abuja while those in the state were not in their constituencies but were hiding in the state capital.

It was mixed reactions in Osun State with the people saying while some lawmakers have sent them relief materials, others had abandoned them in this difficult time.

A resident of Osogbo, Mr Oseni Mudasiru, said the senator representing Osun Central Senatorial District, Dr Ajibola Basiru and Osogbo Federal Constituency, Bukola Oyewo have not done anything for their constituents in terms of relief items since the commencement of the lockdown in the state to contain the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Chairman of newspaper distributors in the state, Mr Mohammed Azeez Olaiya, also confirmed Mudasiru’s claim and also hoped that the lawmakers would soon reach out to them.

For the senator representing Osun East Senatorial District, Francis Fadahunsi, his constituents also have the same sad tale. They said they have not received relief materials from him.

In Osun West Senatorial District, constituents said they have not received palliatives from the Iwo-born senator representing them in the upper chamber of the National Assembly. They, however, confirmed that member of the House of Representatives representing Ede/Egbedore federal constituency distributed palliative materials.

However, a newspaper distributor in Osogbo federal constituency, Mr Kehinde Popoola, told Daily Trust that he received palliative materials from Bukoye.

Also, Mr Lawal Mohammed, a poultry farmer in Osogbo said he has eight children and that his business has collapsed. He said he got beans, semovita and spaghetti from Bukoye.

A community leader, Chief Adetoyese Olayanju said Basiru sent relief materials to him and expressed gratitude to the senator.

A resident of Osun from Ife-Ijesa federal constituency, Mr Ajibola Olubi, told Daily Trust that the member, House of Representatives from the constituency, Hon Busayo Oluwole-Oke, distributed relief materials to his constituents.

Similarly, the palliatives distributed by federal lawmakers from Abia State have attracted mixed feelings.

Our correspondent spoke to some constituents in Aba North/Aba South Federal Constituency, Ikwuano, Umuahia North and South Federal Constituency, Arochukwu/ Ohafia Federal Constituency and Umunneochi/ Isuikwuato Federal Constituency.

The lawmakers were accused by some of their constituents of handing over the palliatives to their party members in the various wards. Some said they only heard of palliatives but never saw any distributed. Those who were reached said what they got was very shameful and embarrassing.

In Enugu State, a former Deputy President of the Senate, Senator Ike Ekweremadu, at the weekend, donated palliatives and cash worth millions of Naira to his constituents in Enugu West Senatorial District.

But his palliatives generated mixed reactions. While some of the constituents commended him for the gesture, others asked for more.

A constituent in Awgu Local Government Area, Ike Ugwu said: “People think the NASS members have done their best but we think their best is not enough yet.

At Enugu East Senatorial District, it was not quite clear whether Senator Chimaroke Nnamani (PDP) and the House of Representatives member in the area, Rep Nnolim Nnaji, who is also Chairman, House of Representatives Committee on Aviation, have made any donations.

However, a member of the constituency, Mr Ndubuisi Chineme, an Enugu-based fashion designer appealed to the lawmakers to help cushion the effect of the lockdown.

Over the last week, federal and state legislators in Borno State have continued to trickle back to their constituencies with assistances to cushion the effect of the partial lockdown in the largely IDP- populated state.

Already, the 28 members of the state assembly have contributed 50 per cent of their monthly salaries for the months of April and May to the state COVID-19 committee to prevent the spread of the disease.

In Ekiti State, there are nine federal lawmakers. While some of them have donated cash and relief materials to their constituents, the effort of others to cushion the effects of the coronavirus lockdown are not known.

Senator Ike Ekweremadu, who is also Chairman of the South-East Senate Caucus, said he would continue to work with his colleagues “to ensure that the South East gets its fair and equitable share of every intervention by the federal government in addition to our modest individual initiatives to help our constituents in these trying times.”

“I call on the Presidency to consider increasing the number of beneficiaries as well as the amount given to individual beneficiaries in the Conditional Cash Transfer programme in order to impact a more significant number of indigent Nigerians,” the lawmaker said.

Senator Danbaba Dambuwa, PDP, Sokoto South Senatorial District, said though they were not given anything by the federal government for their constituents, he had spent millions of Naira in purchasing different items distribution to his constituents.

“I am not doing it because of politics. This has been part of me long before joining politics in 2014,” he said."
149,149,http://freerepublic.com/focus/f-bloggers/3838274/posts,Yikes: NY Policy Has Required People Who Tested Positive for Wuhan Coronavirus to Be Admitted Into Nursing Homes,,freerepublic.com,"One of the most at-risk populations when it comes to the Wuhan coronavirus are those in nursing homes. The first place we really became aware of the virus in this country was at a nursing home in the state of Washington, The Life Center in Kirkland, where there were 3 deaths from the virus before March 11. Since then, at least 24 others have died there.

Governments seem to have grasped that the elderly are most at risk from the virus.

Gov. Andrew Cuomo even named his stay-at-home order after his own mother, Matilda ­Cuomo, because he wanted to emphasize the importance of protecting the elderly. My mother is not expendable and your mother is not expendable and our brothers and sisters are not expendable, he said in March.

So one would think Cuomo would understand that a nursing home population would be one that you would most want to protect.

But in fact, his administration issued an order requiring nursing homes to admit and readmit people who tested positive for the virus. According to the New York Post, Gov. Cuomo claimed he didnt know about the policy earlier this week. But his Health Commissioner Howard Zucker confirmed it. If you are positive, you should be admitted back to a nursing home, he said. The necessary precautions will be taken to protect the other residents there.

The state concedes that 3,448 residents of nursing homes or adult-care facilities are known to have died from the coronavirus, or nearly 25 percent of all deaths in New York. More than 2,000 of the total are in the five boroughs, and officials acknowledge that the real numbers are almost certainly higher. [ .]

The COVID-19 readmission policy was adopted March 25 and was contained in a Health Department directive that says, No resident shall be denied readmission or admission to the [nursing home] solely based on a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of COVID-19, Newsday reported last month.

The problem was that not only did they order the people back into the nursing homes but then the nursing homes didnt have the adequate PPE to be able to deal with that, according to people like Assemblyman Ron Kim (D-Queens), who didnt accept Zuckers claims that the necessary precautions were being taken.

Its either hes lying or they have absolutely no idea whats going on on the ground, Kim said.

The staff, the families, everyone is telling me theres completely a lack of support and they dont have the necessary PPE [personal protective equipment] to be safe.

Arline Mullin wondered why people havent been asking questions about this. She wrote a letter and did an interview with Michael Goodwin of the New York Post.

I am wondering who will hold Gov. Cuomo accountable for the deaths of so many older people due to his reckless decision to place covid19 patients in nursing and rehabilitation homes, the letter began. I am writing as a daughter who lost her beautiful 88 year old mother who was receiving physical therapy at one such facility. [ .]

For her part, Arlene Mullin is not satisfied. In an interview Tuesday, the Long Island educator said she has sent four emails to Cuomos office on the issue but has never received a response.

I get it, its a crisis, she said of the pandemic. But I really want to know why the governor would put that population at such risk.

Her mom, Diana Mongiello, a great-grandmother, was in a rehab center that had accepted coronavirus patients when she developed a fever on April 5. At 8 a.m. the next day, a nursed called to say Mongiello tested positive. Five hours later, she was pronounced dead.

On top of all that, on Wednesday, when Gov. Cuomo mocked people desperate to work to be able to feed their families and he told them to get jobs as essential workers, he made a comment about nursing homes that got less attention. He said that it wasnt the state governments responsibility to provide PPE for nursing homes, although it was their responsibility to check on compliance with laws in the use of such equipment.

Technically, thats legally true. Just like technically, it isnt really the federal governments responsibility to provide things to New York which they should have had themselves. But despite that, President Donald Trump covered New Yorks back as much as he could. Imagine if Trump had said it wasnt his responsibility. But when youve actually ordered nursing homes to take people who are positive and they dont have the ability to refuse or send them to the hospital, then saying you have no responsibility for the result is more than a little callous, when youre the reason theyre in the mess they are in.

On Thursday, Cuomo tried to clean it up, saying the state would be checking on compliance in the nursing homes to see if they are wearing PPE and isolating patients. But at this point, with hospitalizations leveling off, why are still you requiring homes that are not as prepared or as knowledgeable as hospitals to assume that burden and danger? It makes no sense."

Sterilizing face masks, however, is not among those tasks. New Hampshire fire officials have posted a warning against putting in microwaves the face masks used amid the COVID-19 pandemic in an attempt to sterilize them.

In a post on their Facebook page, firefighters said that putting masks inside microwaves could set the area ablaze. The post read, “The NH State Fire Marshal’s Office (NHFMO) would like to remind everyone that ‘microwaving their masks to kill germs’ is a fire hazard and an extremely bad idea.” Photos of extremely burnt masks accompanied the post.

According to firefighters, cloth masks can heat up rapidly and catch fire. In the case of disposable masks, they have a nose wire made of metal that can cause a spark and a fire. According to experts, at the very least, it can break your microwave, and at the worst, a fire can break out in the kitchen.

Federal and local governments in several states in the U.S., such as New York, are requiring residents to cover their faces with face masks or scarves if they go outside. You can now see residents with face coverings whenever you visit public places in these states. Some businesses are even refusing entrance to those who are not wearing a face mask or cover.

Since surgical masks are in short supply, residents have been encouraged to make their own out of cloth or fabric materials. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have called for such cloth masks to be “washed routinely” in the washing machine. In the case of the New York State Department of Health, they advised that masks should be frequently changed and laundered if they are already wet or soiled.

The CDC has said that masks washing these masks with detergent will sterilize them. After washing, you can simply hang it to dry, meaning there is no need to put them inside microwaves. The warning posted by the NH State Fire Marshal’s Office (NHFMO) came about after reports of an emerging trend that involve placing masks inside microwaves for two to three minutes.

The Colorado River Fire Rescue also posted a similar warning telling residents not to put any face mask in the microwave for any amount of time. Tennessee’s Greeneville/Greene County Office of Emergency Management also posted their own warning, urging people not to microwave their homemade masks."

By Wednesday, the order had been rescinded, according to New York Daily News.

“This guidance, proposed by physician leaders of the EMS Regional Medical Control Systems and the State Advisory Council — in accordance with American Heart Association guidance and based on standards recommended by the American College of Emergency Physicians and adopted in multiple other states — was issued April 17, 2020 at the recommendation of the Bureau of Emergency Medical Services, and reflected ‎nationally recognized minimum standards,” the Health Department said in a statement.

“However,” it added, “they don’t reflect New York’s standards and for that reason DOH Commissioner Dr. Howard Zucker has ordered them to be rescinded.”

Some New York communities, including Nassau County and New York City, had implemented those protocols last month.

The “COVID-19 Public Health Emergency EMS Cardiac Arrest Standards of Care” mandated statewide by the State Department of Health was issued April 18 and is now in effect.

Some emergency workers were not pleased with the new rule. Oren Barzilay, head of a New York union for EMTs and paramedics, told the Post earlier this week.

“They’re not giving people a second chance to live anymore,” Barzilay said before the order was changed.

152,152,https://www.downtoearth.org.in/blog/water/fight-against-covid-19-is-a-fight-for-water-against-inequality-70661,"Fight against COVID-19 is a fight for water, against inequality",Let us end our water divides. It is already late,www.downtoearth.org.in,"Let us end our water divides. It is already late

Indians woke up very late to the threat of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, in the first week of March. The first thing that people were advised to do was wash hands with soaps or liquid hand wash agents.

Alcohol-based sanitisers that anyway are a luxury for most Indians, vanished from the market within no time. While soaps come at an affordable price, the liquid hand wash remains a dream for a majority of Indians.

The need therefore narrows down to Rs 5-10 soaps. Most Indians perhaps can buy a soap, that is said to be no less effective than a liquid hand wash in cleaning hands. But there is another thing that determines who can afford a hand wash and who cannot. That’s water.

Access to quality water at one’s doorstep divides India like nothing else. And as the summer sets in, this divide grows.

With handwashing at the core of our fight against the novel coronavirus (SARS-COV-2), water really determines who is more vulnerable and who is less. The relatively privileged classes, that are under lockdown in their homes, with tap water connections and the ability to buy groceries, soaps and hand wash, have nothing to worry so far.

The only worry is they are now using at least twenty to forty times more water in washing their hands than they normally used to do.

We have been advised, for our own good, to wash our hands each time we touch a surface, a door handle, go out to get groceries, medicines, vegetables; each time we do almost anything. The expert advice is to wash hands with soap or liquid hand wash for at least 20-30 seconds each time.

That means we need to use at least two litres of water per wash. With a minimum of 20 washes a day, a person requires at least 40 litres water per day in a country that is striving hard to provide 55 litres per person per day of tap water by 2024.

Even if someone uses water judiciously and does not waste a single drop, the required amount is still too high. The hand wash is therefore a luxury for most of the villagers and slum dwellers, who do not have water supply at their doorstep.

Storage is another issue for the common villager and slum dweller. In India, seven per cent of the population are without even a basic supply of water close to their homes. About 81 per cent rural Indians don’t have a tap connection at home.

They bring water from some source outside, between a few metres to several kilometres away, and store that for the day’s consumption. And what is stored, many often not more than a few buckets, is normally carried by the female members of the families, as is the usual tradition in India.

Handwashing among these sections of the society, both in rural and urban areas, is therefore practically limited to one or two times. And most of them are not privileged to have soaps. Some wash their hands with detergent cakes and powders, soil and ash.

The protocol, the warnings, don’t matter to them. They don’t have the resources. Government support has been useful, though not sufficient. With no income in sight, perhaps for months together, no one wants to invest in soaps.

Some of whom I spoke to, felt they could survive the crisis if they were at home and had basic food stocks. Many who use public water sources to meet their daily chores, are not aware of the restrictions to use public bathing ghats, bore-wells, open wells and other sources.

These sources, no matter how safe they are as defined under Census guidelines, are not safe at these times especially when the water is still, drying up due to summer, and being used by several people at one time.

In these challenging times, we are reminded with more emphasis, that these are the sources that meet water needs — for daily chores — of the majority of rural India. Even a huge chunk of the urban poor depend on these to bathe, wash their hands after and before food, after using a toilet, cleaning utensils, washing clothes, so on and so forth.

Then, there is the new segment of marginalised people created by COVID1-9: Migrant workers. Millions of them, who could not get sufficient time to prepare to return back their homes after the lockdown was announced, have very limited access to water.

Many were moved by the scenes of misery faced by these people, treated as second grade citizens of the country. They were seen carrying their children on their shoulders, walking down hundreds of kilometres, with no food and money to buy anything.

At some places, they were provided food and water and at others, they were unwelcome guests, beaten up and tortured by the police. After the initial confusion, governments started to act to help them. Civil society also came to their rescue.

However, one thing is sure: They are not washing their hands. They don’t have access to water. The Supreme Court has already intervened and has asked states to provide proper shelter, food, clean drinking water and sanitation facilities to migrants who are being debarred from going back to their homes.

In general, water provisioning on the highways and public places even for well-to-do tourists is very poor. All of us who travel on the road for work or during vacation, have to buy bottled water. That’s during normal times.

During such unprecedented time of crisis, the shops are closed and even if they were open, the migrants on the road would have no money to buy water. I saw the interview of a man who had just Rs 3 in hand and had set out for a 400-kilometre journey, with his little child on his shoulder.

Another person said buying one bottle of water would mean dispensing with 10 per cent of the daily wage he earned. And he was not earning anymore. The factory owner gave him Rs 500, out of the thousands of rupees wage that was due, as an emergency amount to flee.

Though not all of them had to go through the inhuman experience of being sprayed with chlorinated water, not getting safe water on the way or where they are being settled is no less of a crisis.

Thirty per cent of all migrants travelling to their homes might be carrying the risk of coronavirus, the Centre had informed the Supreme Court. After this, states have been asked to shelter migrants and not let them move anymore. Governments have made many provisions to supply food and water, but many complaints from the field remain.

Half the country now faces a water crisis and the situation is getting worse by the year. If pandemics like this increase in their frequencies and intensities, which may actually happen because we have already damaged our natural defence to an irreparable extent, water, our frontline defence against such crisis may fail us in more deadly a way than what we experience now.

And the poor and marginalised will be eliminated first. Let’s conserve our rivers, our water bodies, our natural forests, our creeks, our mangroves, our lakes so on and so forth. Let’s end the water divides. It’s already late,"
153,153,https://www.bangthebook.com/nfl-draft-props-should-miami-draft-a-qb-or-look-elsewhere-heres-a-kindly-suggestion/691689/,NFL Draft Props -- Should Miami Draft a QB or Look Elsewhere? Here's a Kindly Suggestion - .com,"The Miami Dolphins have a lot of questions at quarterback and the choices include Tua Tagovailoa, Justin Herbert, and proven NFL guys like Jameis Winston.",www.bangthebook.com,"Yeah, we know. It’s two stories in one day about the Miami Dolphins. But why not? It’s draft day. And BetAnySports patrons have no way of knowing which way the ball is going to bounce when it gets to them. Well, except that they want a quarterback and they aren’t likely to deal the #5 overall pick unless it’s part of a package to move up.

There’s little suspense with Cincinnati, which will go with Joe Burrow. You have to lay 75-1 if you want to bet on the Heisman Trophy winner. Beyond that, there’s a lot of the great unknown.

A rumor – Tua Tagovailoa may be “dropping” on draft boards, because of his injury history and rather low Wonderlic test (13 out of 50, the lowest among QB’s). But who knows? He’s priced at +165 to be the THIRD quarterback taken. That would mean Justin Herbert has to go ahead of him. Well, unless somebody fell in love with Love (Jordan, that is).

Yes, Miami is quarterback-obsessed, it would seem, and that, it is said, has been the focus of the entire 2019 season, leading into today. And they haven’t had a “franchise guy” in a long time. They have someone who, just two years ago, was looked upon that way (Josh Rosen). But they have seen enough of him to make a thumbs-down call on him – I guess. So maybe he gets traded along the line.

They played well over the season’s second half under Ryan Fitzpatrick (who had a 48 Wonderlic, by the way), and that makes him an ideal backup/bridge guy.

But if I was in the Dolphins’ front office, I might, at the risk of losing my job, suggest a different scenario.

With Tom Brady leaving New England, I think the general consensus is that the AFC East is tightening up a little. The Dolphins, in fact, are priced at +1100 at BetAnySports to win the division, which makes them the longshot but not an impossibility.

It is clear they are making moves to win. With all the cap room they had, they signed four players who could be starters on the defense – ends Shaq Lawson and Emmanuel Ogbah, linebacker Kyle Van Noy and cornerback Byron Jones, along with running back Jordan Howard and offensive linemen Ted Karras and Erick Flowers.

But if they draft Tua or Justin Herbert (who is +160 to be the second QB to go, and -175 to be the third), they will have to tolerate a period of development. How long will that take?

And this team still needs a lot of personnel. So my suggestion?

Sign a free agent. But not Cam Newton, who is 30 and quite possibly damaged goods by now.

He’s out there. He’s available. And even though he threw 30 interceptions last year, he hasn’t always been THAT erratic.

I think that when you are considering a quarterback in the draft, you have to ask yourself whether your potential pick is better than what you have, or COULD have. Well, the Dolphins have already decided that Rosen isn’t their guy, but will Tua or Herbert be as productive as Winston? That’s a good question.

After all, even though I’d admit that he hasn’t won any playoff games, Winston is one of a handful of quarterbacks in the history of the NFL – one of only eight, in fact – to have thrown for 5000 yards in a season. No one is going to accuse him of having a “low football IQ.” And he’s only 26 years old, so he’s not a thing of the past.

Give him an offensive line and a running game, and he might just be able to carve up some defenses.

That is, if the Dolphins want to be competitive in the division in 2020, AND have a quarterback of the future at the same time.

You can bet on NFL Draft props at BetAnySports, not to mention simulated sports action in basketball, hockey and football!

154,154,https://phys.org/news/2020-04-huge-ravages-poland-largest-nature.html,Huge fire ravages Poland's largest nature reserve,,phys.org,"Massive wildfires have ravaged Poland's largest nature reserve, the Biebrza National Park, as the country faces its worst drought in years.

After the first flames struck Sunday, the blaze spread across 6,000 hectares or 10 percent of the park, which features some of Europe's best preserved wetlands and is home to moose, beavers, wolves and unique birds.

""It's a great tragedy... Usually at this time of year, everything here is under water. I spoke to a firefighter who said they've never dealt with anything like this before,"" local resident Joanna Skrzypkowska told AFP.

""They're fighting really hard... they didn't sleep for three nights, just battled the fires, before help arrived,"" said the 56-year-old teacher, ecologist and farmer from the village of Wolka Piaseczna.

Park director Andrzej Grygoruk told the website Noizz that the last time Biebrza saw a major fire was in 2003.

'Without rain we could be in danger'

The environment ministry said it believes illegal grass burning was to blame for the fire, with the situation aggravated by strong wind and drought.

Skrzypkowska said climate change, a snowless winter and local water management also played a role in the fire, which she says has fortunately not spread to the forests and has abated somewhat.

She added that since Wednesday the volunteer firefighters—who ran to the blaze on foot with shovels—have been bolstered by colleagues from nearby cities as well as planes and helicopters.

But firefighters say it is unclear when they will be able to put out the fire completely.

""I'm afraid it won't happen until we get some real, proper rain,"" said Skrzypkowska, adding that it has now been a month or two without precipitation.

President Andrzej Duda spoke of the nationwide drought on Wednesday, calling on citizens to be reasonable about their water use and telling reporters: ""Without rain, we could be in danger.""

In Warsaw, the water level of the Vistula river has sunk to 60 centimetres (24 inches), uncovering many sandbanks.

Biebrza National Park is known as a bird watcher's paradise: some 270 species have been observed there, according to its website.

""For some waterfowl species, Biebrza marshes are among the last refuges for the survival of their population in Central Europe,"" according to the site.

Park management said Thursday that it has received nearly 1.2 million zloty (260,000 euros, $290,000) in donations to help firefighters after setting up a special bank account for the cause."

“We will have coronavirus in the fall. I am convinced of that,” said Dr. Anthony Fauci, a top epidemiologist at the National Institutes of Health, at the same briefing some minutes later. Fauci’s blunt style has sometimes annoyed Trump and often thrilled a public hungry for accurate information. He added that preparations made now would likely mitigate the impact of the virus come autumn.

Both men were speaking in the context of comments made the day before by Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, to the Washington Post. He told the newspaper that not only was the coronavirus likely to return in the fall, but that its effect would be compounded by the flu.

Both the flu and COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, are afflictions of the respiratory system. The flu is an upper respiratory disease while COVID-19 attacks the lungs.

“There’s a possibility that the assault of the virus on our nation next winter will actually be even more difficult than the one we just went through,” Redfield told the Washington Post. He added later that the nation was bound to face “the flu epidemic and the coronavirus epidemic at the same time.”

That would put enormous strain on hospitals and possibly lead to widespread shutdowns of the kind that have marked the first months of 2020.

A White House plainly irritated by Redfield took the press to task. On Wednesday afternoon, new White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said in a Fox News interview that “the mainstream media” had taken Redfield’s comments “out of context.” She argued that he had merely been advising Americans to receive their annual flu vaccinations.

Trump opened Wednesday’s briefing by denouncing the Washington Post. He took issue, in particular, with the “totally inaccurate” and “ridiculous” headline attached to the Redfield interview: “CDC director warns second wave of coronavirus is likely to be even more devastating.” He had previously railed against the article on Twitter, by criticizing CNN’s report on Redfield’s statements to the Post.)

“He was misquoted,” a visibly frustrated Trump said. “Totally misquoted.” He went on to say that Redfield’s “whole purpose in making the statement was to get a flu shot.” And he downplayed the likely seasonal nature of the coronavirus, arguing — in contravention of what most epidemiologists have concluded – that once the virus is defeated, it will be gone for good.

“We may not even have corona coming back,” he said during a particularly tense moment during the briefing.

Redfield, who has not been a significant presence at the coronavirus briefings, took to the podium, explaining the challenges of facing “two respiratory illnesses circulating at the same time.” He added that that combination would make next fall “more difficult” than the current outbreak has been.

Redfield did say that people should “embrace the flu vaccine with confidence.” Widespread immunity against the flu would presumably free up resources to battle the coronavirus all over again, without having to open up a second epidemiological front.

While the issue of how severe that autumn outbreak will be remains a matter of speculation, Redfield appeared to hold firm in the assertions that have been the focus of so much controversy.

“I’m accurately quoted in the Washington Post,” said Redfield, who had earlier shared the article on Twitter to his 182,000 followers.

On Wednesday, the Indonesian Forum for the Environment (Walhi) blamed the country’s capitalist economy and the greed of corporations and investors for the environmental damage that they said had caused COVID-19 to “haunt” the Earth.

The group was referring to a 2016 United Nations Environment Program report, which found that the risk of emergent and fast-spreading diseases increased as encroachment upon natural habitats by mankind intensified. The proximity enabled pathogens found in wild areas to spill over into livestock and humans.

“The mismanagement of our country and of Mother Earth has made us realize that the planet we live on is no longer safe; the Earth is no longer able to sustain the environmental damage of greedy investments,” Walhi wrote in a statement on Earth Day.

As the global community commemorated the 50th annual Earth Day on Wednesday, COVID-19 continued to cast a pall over most of the world’s countries, dampening the celebrations.

Further research is required to determine all the factors that have caused the pandemic, but so far, much of the scientific world suspects that bats and pangolins have acted as carriers of SARS-CoV-2, said Indonesian Institute of Sciences (LIPI) microbiology researcher Sugiyono Saputra on Tuesday.

SARS-CoV-2 is the coronavirus strain that causes the pneumonia-like disease, which has infected more than 2.4 million people worldwide and killed almost 170,000, according to World Health Organization data on Wednesday.

The virus is believed to have first emerged in animals sold in a wildlife market in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year, although newer studies have cast doubt on this assumption.

Indonesian researchers have urged the government to implement stronger measures against the cross-border wildlife trade to anticipate the possible spread of COVID-19. Animal rights organizations have also called on the government to close all markets that slaughter or sell illegal wildlife.

A coalition of several animal rights groups wrote in late January that they had visited a “good number” of animal markets where the “conditions are the same as those being described by scientists as the perfect breeding grounds for new and deadly zoonotic viruses”, potentially exposing thousands of people in Indonesia every day to a variety of diseases originating from animals.

Many rural communities across Indonesia still have an appetite for wildlife, such as bats, snakes, wild boar and dogs, putting those who eat them at risk of contracting zoonotic diseases.

The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), a panel of United Nations experts on biodiversity, estimates that zoonotic diseases kill about 700,000 people a year.

The virus that caused the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic – which also originated in China and killed about 800 people worldwide in 2002 and 2003 – originated in bats, civets and raccoons. The virus that caused the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak, which killed 282 people in Saudi Arabia in 2014, was transmitted from camels to humans.

Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR) senior scientist Herry Purnomo urged urban dwellers to refrain from eating the cuisine of rural communities to keep interactions between wild animals and humans at a minimum and prevent such diseases from spreading in the future.

“When we do damage to nature, nature will find a new balance that humans may not like,” Herry said on Wednesday.

He also advised tightening protocols and certifications to ensure food safety in wild animal consumption but warned that illegal markets might thrive if the wildlife trade was banned outright.

UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said in New York that while the impact of COVID-19 was both “immediate and dreadful, [...] there is another, even deeper emergency: the planet’s unfolding environmental crisis”.

The pandemic has not been all bad news for the environment. Factory shutdowns and travel bans have curbed carbon emissions and made the skies clearer in many countries, including Indonesia. However, experts say the cleaner air may be short-lived as economies will likely try to make up for lost time.

Reports of wild animals roaming some of the world’s biggest cities have also emerged as people retreat into their homes and more countries go under lockdown, AFP reported.

Indonesia is still miles away from resolving its environmental and wildlife problems. National Disaster Mitigation Agency (BNPB) data shows that land and forest fires ravaged 942,484 hectares of the country in 2019, almost double the area in 2018 – gutting natural habitats and biodiversity.

""The numbers are really very small that's good news but we would want to see that good news for a lot longer until we would be comfortable to moving to the next stage,"" Dr Fitzgerald told 9News.

He believes that next stage will be a ""gentle opening up"" of society about a month or so from now.

That could see all students returning to school, people returning to office-based work and retail stores reopening.

""It's all about the risk of the closure of our systems against the risk of the virus,"" he said.

""In some ways it's a reversal of the way we transitioned out.""

The next stage, he predicts, would see the easing of restrictions on small social gatherings like dinner parties.

Dog parks, playgrounds and gyms could reopen within a few months by his calculations.

""If you know the people who are coming to your house party you can trace them if there is a problem,"" he said.

Last to reopen would likely be pubs, cafes, restaurants and other social spots and when they do open it will be under strict social distancing restrictions.

For instance tables at restaurants may need to be 1.5 metres apart while patrons could have their temperature taken before entering the premises.

Though a time frame would be entirely dependent on the rate of infections.

When restaurants open, allowances for larger wedding celebrations and funerals could also be made.

The professor, well-versed in disaster recovery, believes in three to six months regular interstate travel and trips to New Zealand could be on the cards.

Mass gatherings at events like football matches or concerts look a long way off - six months at least.

""If we go to Suncorp for Broncos (versus) Cowboys we have 50,000 people and therefore the risk of one of them having it is 50,000 times,"" Dr Fitzgerald explained.

The very last thing to return to normal would be international travel that is unlikely for at least a year, Dr Fitzgerald said."

Amid the widespread out break of Covid 19 when every country is taking steps to contain and trying to find a way to tackle one of the worst disease of recent times, TV anchors and media organisations and right wing hatemongers in India are leaving no opportunity to demonize, harass and vilify the Indian Mulsims. Indian media is busy in spreading bigotry and communal hatred in relation to the Tablighi Jamaat event. The way media is reporting on Tablighi Jamaat and Islam plays a role in the spread of Islamophobia. Islamophobic hashtags and memes started soon on social media after the alleged so called Tablighi Jamaat event.

Since the right-wing hatemongers and fringe groups have taken advantage of people’s fears and vulnerabilities amid coronavirus pandemic in order to push disinformation, fake news and Islamophobic tweets and posts on digital platforms to vilify Muslims. As a result of their actions, attacks against Muslim escalate and call for economic boycott of Muslims in India has been increasingly becoming everydayness of routine. The hashtag #Islamophobia_In_India is in response to right-wing hatemongers, unbridled media trial & vilification of Tablighi Jamaat and unending witch-hunt of Muslim scholar-activists as well. Social media users especially Arabian and Indian Muslims and their followers stood against Islamophobia as well anti-Muslim propaganda by turning the hashtag #Islamophobia_In_India into top trending topic on Twitter for several hours in worldwide and particularly in India.

Earlier, the hashtag #coronajihad was used nearly 300,000 times between March 29 and April 3, predominantly in India and the U.S., according to Equality Labs, a South Asian digital human rights group based in the U.S. The organization tracked hundreds of anti-Muslim hashtags, many of which depict Muslims as suicide bombers strapped with “virus bombs” and included terms like ”#IslamicVirus, #BioJihad, and #MuslimVirus.” (reported by huffington post)

News headlines ran with the story that the Tablighi conference was the source of the national Covid-19 outbreak. In swift order, Hindutva nationalists took to social media, dubbing the virus “Corona Jihad” and the “Muslim Virus.” These labels were accompanied by vile caricatures of Muslims spitting on bystanders and physicians, and doctored videos of Muslims disobeying stay at home orders.

OIC’s tweet on growing tide of Islamophobia in India

The Organisation of Islamic Cooperation’s Independent Permanent Human Rights Commission (OIC-IPHRC) alleged that “Islamophobia” is on the rise in India and had urged India to take “urgent steps” to protect rights of the Muslim community.

“OIC-IPHRC condemns the unrelenting vicious #Islamophobic campaign in #India maligning Muslims for spread of #COVID-19 as well as their negative profiling in media subjecting them to discrimination & violence with impunity.” “[We] urge the Indian Govt to take urgent steps to stop the growing tide of Islamophobia in India and protect the rights of its persecuted Muslim minority as per its obligations under international Human Rights law,” wrote in another tweet. Calling on the Indian government to take steps to protect Muslim minorities who are being “negatively profiled,” facing “discrimination and violence” amidst the COVID-19 crisis, the 57-member Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) has criticised what it called “growing Islamophobia” in India.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on sunday said on Twitter that COVID-19 does not see race, religion, colour, caste, creed, language or borders before striking. Our response and conduct thereafter should attach primacy to unity and brotherhood. We are in this together.

Many social media users shared a tweet of UAE Princess Hend Al Qassimi widely in which she had warned those who are writing anti-Muslim and anti-Islamic posts on social media. She wrote on Twitter that

Nabiya Khan, Muslim activist raised voice against state suppression and ongoing witch-hunt of Muslim scholar-activists. She wrote on Twitter that

A tweet by Kuwaiti based scholar Dr. Abdullah Al Shoreka went viral on social media in which he had written that We hope that the (Persian) Gulf states and the world will expel every racist person who incites human rights violations in India and incites crimes against humanity. In his other tweet, he emphasized the importance of syncretic culture in India, said that

The calamitous outbreak of Covid-19 virus and pandemic was unanticipated and unprecedented, but the existing architecture and design of Islamophobic persecution and spree arrest of Muslim activists in India now has been firmly in place."

162,162,https://www.forbes.com/sites/heidilynnekurter/2020/04/23/4-ways-to-onboard-new-hires-quickly-without-harming-the-employee-experience/,4 Ways To Onboard New Hires Quickly Without Harming The Employee Experience,The greatest challenge that comes with hiring at scale is the risk of harming the candidate-to-employee experience.,www.forbes.com,"Since the spread of COVID-19, a majority of employers have been forced to shut down, furlough and layoff their workers. Conversely, companies such as Amazon and Kroger, have had to expand hiring effort to keep up with demand. In the past four weeks, Amazon hired more than 100,000 new associates and plans to add at least 75,000 more across the United States. To prevent further delays in meeting customers’ needs, employers are expediting their application to employment process. As a result, employee onboarding is being drastically reduced.

The greatest challenge that comes with hiring at scale is the risk of harming the candidate-to-employee experience. In high-volume onboarding, employees are often viewed as a means to an end. They’re given the bare minimum to survive, expected to adapt quickly and make as few errors as possible. A poor onboarding experience is a lose-lose scenario for both the employer and employee.

According to Employee Benefit News, it costs 33% of an employee’s annual salary to replace them if they leave. However, those who stay, without proper training, cost the company more through poor customer experiences, increased errors, lack of quality and more. Onboarding, even during a crisis, is one of the most important experiences when integrating a new employee into the company. A poor onboarding experience is just as bad as no onboarding.

Even though companies are eager to meet short-term demand, they need to keep in mind the long-term consequences such as
• lack of confidence in their role
• lack of trust in the company

Here are four ways companies can quickly onboard their new hires without destroying the candidate experience.

Onboarding shouldn’t be confused with orientation. Orientation focuses on the routine tasks such as HR documents that must be completed to make the new hire’s employment official. Before the employee joins the company they should have all relevant material to help them understand the company, their position and their benefits. These might include access to the company portal so they can access pertinent and relevant trainings, an onboarding agenda and relevant contact information, should they have any questions.

In response to the crisis, Department of Homeland Security loosened restrictions to accommodate employers hiring and onboarding at scale but that doesn’t mean it can be neglected altogether.

Whereas orientation is a one-time event, onboarding is an ongoing process. Depending on the company, onboarding can last from 90 days to one year with milestones set up along the way. The goal of onboarding is to help a new hire integrate into their team, culture and company. It’s setting them up to win and be successful in their new role by the end of their onboarding.

Onboarding a new hire without a plan is one of the quickest ways to lose a quality employee. When new hires are left to fend for themselves they feel undervalued and unappreciated. Companies admit one of their biggest challenges is their high turnover rate. This is because 88% of companies don’t onboard well, according to Gallup. As a result, 20% of new hires leave within the first 45 days of starting.

For companies like Amazon who are hiring en mass, it’s difficult to provide one-on-one time for each individual new hire. Most employers want to minimize the amount of time it takes to train an employee and have them producing results almost immediately. Understandably so, especially since they’re struggling to keep up with demand. However, throwing a new hire into their job without any training or strategic integration sets them up for failure, ultimately harming the company and customer experience.

It’s vital that HR, hiring managers and team members come together to help provide training, mentoring and support. Employees who crave more responsibility can serve as an onboarding mentor where they’ll provide job shadowing and insight for the job. Managers are responsible for providing a more comprehensive training, explaining expectations, giving feedback and establishing goals. HR should check-in frequently to see what gaps need to be filled and additional training should be provided.

This is as much of a hectic time for the employer as it is for the candidate. They might have just been laid off from a well-paying corporate job and are left to take a much lower salary to try to make ends meet. Everyone is experiencing a hardship and it’s important to be thankful for their contribution, recognize their desire to work and support them in being successful in their role.

Onboarding remote workers is going to look different than onboarding in-person ones. Technology is instrumental in both cases. Having the right tools in place ensures efficiency and effectiveness. The more technology takes on, the more human to human interaction, HR and hiring managers are able to give their new employees. The key is understanding where technology fits in and where a human is required.

Amy Champigny, senior product manager at Deltek, explained “when developing relationships for the first time, it’s important to rely on video to lead the interaction. This allows both the manager and new hire to read tone of voice, facial expression and feel a sense of connection.” Tech isn’t meant to replace humans, but to connect the dots and enhance the relationship between managers and employees.

Software such as Zoom or Loom can be used to answer commonly asked questions, hold trainings, have meetings as well as screen-record how to use systems or carry out task processes. They can be accessed at any time to refresh knowledge. Connecteam is a multi-functional tool that has various benefits. It can be used to
• clock-in and out of shifts

The added benefit is employees can access the app from their phone at any time.

Aimie Ye, GoCo, speaks highly about using cloud-based onboarding systems. GoCo is one of many great platforms used for onboarding and hiring large amounts of employees. The platform is designed to support various HR tasks remotely such as time tracking, benefits administration, payroll, documents and e-signature, hiring, onboarding, termination and self-serve employee access.

The retention of a new hire hinges on how hands-on and involved their manager is with them. If managers prioritize high volume recruitment without developing and valuing the ones they do hire, they risk rapid turnover and poor customer experiences. UrbanBound reported, “in the US and UK, an estimated $37 billion dollars is spent annually to keep unproductive employees who do not understand their jobs.”

Communication is the foundation of every relationship, personal or professional. Most employees receive little to no feedback during their onboarding and are surprised when they’re let go. This is because managers threw them into their role with little training, no follow-up and high expectations for them to figure it out on their own. Not only is this unfair but it holds even the most talented employees back from performing at their highest potential.

Check-ins are essential to an employee’s success and they should be conducted consistently and frequently. To maximize effectiveness and create a standard, managers should pre-schedule them for the same time and same day every week. The check-ins should be used to see how an employee is doing, offer feedback and support, recognize a job well done and seek out feedback on how to improve as a manager or process inefficiencies."
163,163,https://www.pressreleasepoint.com/cares-airport-funding-state-owned-airports,on CARES Airport Funding for State Owned Airports | PressReleasePoint,"Last week, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announced CARES Act Airport Grant Program funds available to Alaska. Across the state, statistics on 257 airports were used in calculating Alaska’s share of the funding.",www.pressreleasepoint.com,"Last week, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announced CARES Act Airport Grant Program funds available to Alaska. Across the state, statistics on 257 airports were used in calculating Alaska’s share of the funding.

Of the $124.17 million that will come to Alaska, $33 million is designated for the international airports (Anchorage and Fairbanks) and $49 million is flexible funding for state-owned rural airports. The remaining $41.7 million is for non-state owned airports.

I’d like to take the opportunity to clarify how this funding can be used and where it can be allocated for state airports. The funding amount listed for each airport was set by the FAA through airport formulas for the purpose of calculating Alaska’s share of the federal funding. It was not intended or directed that the funding amount listed for each airport be distributed at that specific airport.

As an example, the Cordova Airport is listed at $20,000 based on funding level. That does not mean Cordova Airport will receive $20,000. This funding is not intended as a capital improvement program, as the annual Airport Improvement Program funds are already being executed. Rather, this funding is intended to enable states to preserve their aviation system in light of the coronavirus challenges.

It is important to note that the state’s rural and international airports are not funded the same. Rural airports are funded by the State of Alaska and the state receives minimal revenue for the use of rural airports. Thus, COVID-19 has had minimal impact on the state’s rural airport budget. However, the international airports, Ted Stevens Anchorage and Fairbanks International, rely solely on the revenues generated by the passenger, cargo and customer activity at the airports. The decline in passenger travel due to COVID-19 is having a significant impact on the activity levels of these two airports.

Our ability to use the CARES funds for State of Alaska airports is pending legislative authority. The actual allocations of funding and how it will be used will be determined after discussions with the legislature. Funding will be combined into two categories, international airports ($33 million) and rural airports ($49 million) and will be used collectively to ensure that the state’s highest aviation priorities remain funded."

So naturally, when she developed a cough and a fever by the third week of March, she turned to her hospital for help. However, after repeated attempts of treatment, the 63-year-old passed away with COVID-19 symptoms, according to Fox 2.

“They sent her home saying you are showing signs of COVID,” said Kaila Corrothers, her daughter. “So they were confirming that she most likely had COVID, but they did not test her.”

Corrothers took notes in her calendar the days her mom went to the emergency room. She says that her mom was sent home with cough medicine four times and told to rest. Each time, her fever spiked even higher and her symptoms worsened.

“The fact that she got infected by doing the job she did for 31 years and she couldn’t get taken care of by her own family, meaning Beaumont it’s sad,” said Corrothers. “It is disheartening to say the least.” By the end of March, Gatewood had withered away and developed bi-lateral pneumonia.

“All of this time when you’re telling her to go home and rest it off how do you really rest off bi-lateral pneumonia other than cough medicine to cough it out, it’s too severe at this point,” Corrothers explained.

Eventually, Gatewood collapsed and was rushed to Sinai-Grace Hospital, which was inundated and understaffed at that point. This is where she spent her last days.

“I just went up to the hospital and sat in the parking lot. If this was as close as I can be to her if this is going to happen, I’m going to sit in my car until I get that phone call,” Corrothers said.

Gatewood was two years away from retiring when she died and she had planned to be a full-time grandmother. “She said she’s going to hang in there for a couple more years and she said she going to retire and be the greatest nanny I need her to be,” her daughter explained.

A month ago, when Deborah first went to Beaumont’s ER, the coronavirus outbreak was serious, but many hospitals across the country weren’t nearly as prepared as they could have been with proper testing being scarce. Beaumont didn’t speak to this. However, when asked what their protocol is now for admitting people, Beaumont said, “As patients come to Beaumont for care during this pandemic, we are doing everything we can to evaluate, triage and care for patients based on the information we know at the time. We grieve the loss of any patient to COVID-19 or any other illness.”

Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden says he's planning to begin his search for a running mate in the coming weeks.

He said Tuesday that he expects to form a selection committee by May 1 to begin considering possible VPs.

He told James Corden on ""The Late Late Show"", ""The first and most important quality is someone who, if I were to walk away immediately from the office for whatever reason, that they can be president, and the public could look at that person and say she is capable of being president of the United States tomorrow.""

Biden's already promised his VP will be a woman, but that still leaves quite a few options on the board. Some likely considerations are Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and California Sen. Kamala Harris.

But another popular contender is former first lady Michelle Obama.

Biden said in an interview: ""I'd take her in a heartbeat. She's brilliant. She knows the way around. She is a really fine woman.""

Getting Obama on the ticket with him could boost Biden's chances: According to a Gallup poll, she was the most admired woman in America in 2018 and 2019.

But in her recent memoir, ""Becoming,"" Obama made it clear that she has ""no intention of running for office, ever.""

All that said, Biden hasn't given many hints about who he'll pick. But he said his choice will be announced well before the Democratic National Convention in August."

School could be in session by August, with one in five office workers back at their desks.

A new ""roadmap to pandemic resilience"" out from Harvard University would put 20% of the non-essential workforce back inside their offices by the end of the summer, as part of an overall plan to get the country safely moving again, even as more Americans might become infected with COVID-19, the illness caused by the novel coronavirus.

The reopening plan would cost billions to perform.

""The cost of such a testing and tracing, or TTSI, program—$50 to 300 billion over two years—is dwarfed by the economic cost of continued collective quarantine of $100 to 350 billion a month,"" the report authors write.

In addition to suggesting up to 20 million coronavirus test kits need to be available each day, the plan would require an army of contact tracers, more backup for the essential workforce, as well as better healthcare and financial support for people who must stay home when they become ill, or because they were exposed to someone with the coronavirus.

But in the world according to coronavirus, that is the new normal.",uk.reuters.com,"BASTIA UMBRA, Italy (Reuters) - Simone Mela never dreamed that a traffic light would determine when he could take a bathroom break in the factory where he works. But in the world according to coronavirus, that is the new normal.

And he feels lucky to have a job. Only 200 of the 800 workers at the ISA company, which makes refrigerated display cases for bars, restaurants and supermarkets, have so far been able to return to the factory in Italy’s Umbria region.

The gradual return has been made possible through a combination of solutions ranging from simple to innovative to high tech.

Strips taped on the floor create walking lanes and delineate work areas.

A yellow and green traffic light system was installed to keep the bathrooms safe. Workers flick a switch as they enter or leave the bathroom and the colour of the light tells those who want to enter if they can or have to wait.

The high-tech end of the company’s back-to-work strategy is a system known as SWAT, or System Workers Advance Tracing.

Employees scan an app onto their smartphones and clip a small white device on to their work clothes.

It vibrates if they get too close to another worker and simultaneously sends a signal to a computer database.

“We are sure that it is not a tool to spy on us. It is only a device to increase safety distances and to report close contacts,” said Mela. “If we find a positive case, it will be easier to trace the contacts they had. We feel very safe.”

A similar system is on trial in the port of Antwerp.

ISA’s managers realised that if they wanted to stay in business, they had no choice but to modify work patterns and safety measures.

“To help people to cope with this virus - which unfortunately won’t be going away in coming days and weeks - we developed a hardware and software system to help people work together in a safe way and adhere to social distancing,’ said ISA’s general manager, Marco Giulietti.

Employees’ body temperatures are checked when they enter the factory and they all wear masks, gloves and face shields.

To provide further protection, plexiglas dividers have been put up between work stations along the assembly line. But they extend from the waist up so workers can still pass material and talk to each other."

169,169,https://townhall.com/columnists/emmetttyrrell/2020/04/23/a-call-for-freedom-a-fear-of-unemployment-n2567431,"A Call for Freedom, A Fear of Unemployment",Washington -- There is a growing revolt against the imposition .05/26/2020 20:36:24PM EST.,townhall.com,"Washington -- There is a growing revolt against the imposition of police state government on the Land of the Free. In Michigan, the cry for freedom has been heard as automobiles and pickup trucks flying the Stars and Stripes circle the state capitol. One intrepid reporter even spotted the Stars and Bars of the Confederacy -- though I have searched and searched, and I have yet to see the shocking emblem. In North Carolina, there are citizens marching for freedom, and in Maryland -- once called the ""Free State"" -- the citizenry is restive. Even in goose-stepping California, there is rebellion brewing.

The call is for freedom -- and the fear is of unemployment. Nationally, the unemployment ranks have filled to 13% of the population in a country that, a month ago, was at record high employment. It will get worse.

Does it take open rebellion to get the attention of America's elected officials? I suppose the official calls to wash our hands regularly can be tolerated. Last week, I demonstrated my tolerance and even encouragement for personal hygiene. I urged my readers to wash their hands and to go one step beyond. I urged them to wash their feet, but only after washing hands. I was hoping the president would pick up my suggestion at one of his daily briefings, but so far, he remains mum.

Moreover, I joined with our elected officials and our health care experts in urging social distancing. The approved distance is at least six feet, though I think it was The New York Times that cautioned that six feet might not be sufficient. I believe the Times suggested that if you are walking with a family member, you should expand the sequestered area to at least a city block. With mere friends, I think the Times suggested two city blocks, and you can always communicate via cellphone.

Actually, the term ""social distancing"" is an oxymoron. If one is distancing how can one possibly be social? A more sensible term would be simply to distance oneself from others.

Yet to return to our subject, it is time to note that we are fast approaching the time when what has been a health problem -- no, make that a health crisis -- is becoming an economic crisis, and quite possibly a political crisis. Shutting down the economy as we have can only last so long before everything is shut down. To begin with, our distribution system needs money to operate. You can only get supplies such as food for so long without cash. Some people seem to think money comes from government. Actually, it comes from work, and now people are losing their jobs.

Bob Luddy, the chief executive of leading North Carolina company CaptiveAire, has written an open letter to the governor of his state, Roy Cooper. Bob writes to him that, ""For every COVID-19 case in North Carolina (4,500 estimated), 125 people have lost their jobs (500,000 unemployed across the state)."" He adds poignantly, ""You created this tragedy."" He concludes with an observation that harkens back to American history: ""Your executive orders have quarantined healthy individuals for the first time in American history."" His letter to Cooper should serve as an open letter to all.

Americans in massive numbers have lost their jobs, their religious freedom, their freedom of movement and their freedom of association. They have even lost their sense of security. Do you feel secure with the street crawling with people wearing masks?

It was only a matter of time before the closing down of the country for reasons of public health had to end. We have done all we can for those who suffer from the coronavirus. We can continue serving them, but now we have to allow 330 million Americans to take care of themselves and, in doing so, take care of all of us. Either this is done in an orderly way or the demonstrations will spread. And the economic crisis will become a political crisis.

Here's all the behind the scenes tea.",decider.com,"The queens are here to save us. That’s not only the premise behind We’re Here, HBO’s leap into the world of drag, but it’s also the truth of the moment. We’re Here is more than a makeover show, more than a drag show, and more than a reality show; it’s all three rolled into one, creating a sickening concoction that delivers soul-cleansing catharsis. Does that sound like an overstatement? You just tune into HBO on Thursday, April 23 and see for yourself.

The series follows three 21st century icons of drag (Bob the Drag Queen, Shangela, and Eureka O’Hara) as they pull into small towns across the country and transform a small group of locals into fierce drag divas. But as We’re Here so smartly points out, drag is about way more than death drops big wigs (although those are two essentials). The show uses the art of drag to bring locals out of their closets, highlight the very much alive LGBTQ communities in these towns, and foster a feeling of community between people from disparate walks of life.

So, how did three queens from the RuPaul’s Drag Race kingdom find themselves in an HBO project, one that dropped in full drag in hot as hell Gettysburg? Decider spoke with Eureka O’Hara, Shangela, and Bob the Drag Queen separately about their journey towards We’re Here, the roads they traveled during filming, and the path forward. Their interviews have been edited together for clarity and length.

Decider: How’d you all get involved with We’re Here? What’s the origin story?

Bob the Drag Queen: The show found me more than I found the show. I was approached by the creators and the producers, Johnnie [Ingram] and Stephen [Warren]. I’m not going to lie: it took a little bit of convincing to get me on board, that is true. But once I heard their pitch in person, I really trusted their integrity. I trusted them as storytellers and I was really excited to work on it. Like, really excited.

Eureka O’Hara: I guess they were interested in what they had seen from my personality on Drag Race. I think being from Tennessee too—Johnny’s actually from Tennessee as well, one of the creators. So I think there was a little bit of a love connection there too, like maybe he understood my personality and was excited to have a branch of Tennessee, the small town life, in the show.

Shangela: When Steve and Johnny told me about the idea of three queens traveling to small towns across America to help people kind of realize best versions of themselves and put on a drag show in a place that’s never had them, I was like “Oh my God, yes.” Because I was born in a small town, I came out in a small town. I know these hardships and challenges but I also know the joy of being in a small town, so I wanted to unearth that for people who may feel like they were the only ones like them out there.

The premise of this show is such a far cry from RuPaul’s Drag Race, too, which seems like a pressure-cooker. Was We’re Here less stressful than being on a reality competition show?

Eureka: We’re Here was a dream to be a part of, really. It was definitely emotional stress, but it was different. Rupaul’s Drag Race is a competition series. It’s not real life. They’re “reality” shows because it’s happening in real time, but it’s all scripted, the talent and performances. The only reality you get might be when the girls want to fight or when they’re sewing their costumes stressfully in a two hour period. So it’s not a good take on real life. And this is a real life docuseries—I mean that’s what it’s literally branded and called—about queer life. So it’s literally a 180 degree difference. It’s completely different.

Aside from being on RuPaul’s Drag Race, you’re three different queens. How was it like working together?

Bob : We probably aren’t a trio that you would think of before this show, but we work really well together.

Shangela: We were put together kind of in a Charlie’s Angels kind of way. The things that we have in common are that we are hardworking Drag Race girls that all come from the RuPaul’s Drag Race family that are passionate about our work, especially on stage. So we were all doing that in our own unique ways in life and we got called in by “Charlie,” that would be either HBO or Steve and Johnnie, to go out there and kick some butt against the stigma and against discrimination and connect with different people.

Eureka: We really gained a sisterhood through this experience, the three of us knowing that we’re the only three people going through what we’re going through as far as this project. The three of us walking the town together, figuring out how to navigate our daughters.

‘We’re Here’: How the Groundbreaking Drag Docuseries Sashayed onto HBO

Shangela: One thing that I didn’t know about Bob and Eureka and now I do is how much we lean to each other to uplift each other. When you’re working on a project like this, sometimes the material can be very heavy. We have a heavy load on us because not only are we co-hosts of this show, we’re out there connecting with the people. We’re having to connect sometimes with their families, go through their life experience and situations and kind of figure out how we are going to help kind of pull them out of their shell to put them on this grand stage in their community.

Eureka: It’s kind of amazing that I work with two other girls that have just as big personalities as I have, but also can handle themselves. So it’s really a nice dynamic, there’s nobody like, waiting around to see if Shangela needs help in a conversation. She’s already ran off with it.

Did you collaborate on transforming your local into fierce drag queens?

Bob: If you watch Queer Eye or a show like that, it’s like five people all helping one person. [On We’re Here], me, Shangela, and Eureka, we’re doing our own thing. So it’s not like we have to collaborate on ideas or anything. We each go our own separate ways and we individually have our own teams. So Shangela has a designer, and so do me and Eureka. And then we all have makeup artists and we all have hair people. So it’s not just me putting someone in full drag all by myself, all by my lonesome. It’s actually really skilled people — and when I say skilled I mean like, really fucking skilled. Like these are the people who have made everyone from Beyonce, to have outfits at the Grammys, Diego Montoya, Patryq Howell, people making outfits for people like RuPaul, people who have outfits on RuPaul’s Drag Race. Our design teams are really, super legit.

So the looks that the new drag queens wear in their performance, are those custom built in the time leading up to the show?

Bob : Okay, let me tell you what happened, mama. We roll into town with all these teams. We transform these hotels into basically design suites. Everything is made right there. You have to get measurements and all this stuff, so everything is made within the time that we’re in this town. So we didn’t roll up with some costumes from a costume shop. We rolled up with some sewing machines and some fabric. And by the time the show happened, especially when you have episodes like Twin Falls—I had three drag daughters. All four of those outfits, including the outfit that I’m wearing that week, is all made right there.

And you also have to put together performances with these fledgling queens. Shangela—what was it like giving your daughters the full show-stopping Shangela treatment?

Shangela: I am not a trained choreographer. However I’ve been on stages for over a decade. I’ve toured the world, I’ve performed in every continent except Antarctica, in 2018 I did a tour of 184 cities around the world, okay? The doll knows how to entertain. So if they’re gonna go out there and they’re gonna be Shangela’s daughters? They’re gonna give you what I like to call a beginning, a middle, and an end. And it’s gonna be something that brings you in. And I was able to work with my good friend, long time collaborator Joelapuss to create what she’s always done for me, creating moments through music. And we would put together those numbers and come up with a concept for the show. It takes you somewhere and when you’re finished, you’re like, “Yes ma’am!”

You all tour and perform extensively all over the country, all over the world. What was it like going to these small towns, towns that probably don’t get a stop on the Werq the World tour? Did it change how you present yourself while out of drag?

Bob : There are so many factors involved in how we dress when we walk around the town, including the fact that there’s a camera rolling and I want to look nice. I don’t want to look crummy. I can’t just throw on some jeans and skip down the street looking frumpy. And also the fact that two of us in the cast, me and Eureka both identify as non-binary. Sometimes our clothing choices are eye-turning, to say the least. We’re not dressing that way for shock value, I know personally I dress that way because it’s how I feel nicest. So sometimes there are moments when you might see me wearing a dress in the middle of the day. That’s just because that’s how I feel like presenting on that particular day. I’m not, like, in drag or anything. It’s just how I want to look that day.

Eureka: I’m very lucky because even though I’m overly flamboyant, I am also six-foot-four and 450 pounds. I am a very large human being. So I’m very blessed with large male privilege, no matter if I’m gender fluid or whatever. So I think that’s where I’m able to disarm some people that might at normally react to me a little intensely. I can be a little intimidating myself.

Bob: But we are clearly queer people, I will say that. There’s no question whether or not we’re big gays walking down the street. To see people walk around unabashedly queer apparently is still quite shocking so some people.

How did you handle those tense situations where you’re the only queer person in the room? Some of the places your new daughters take you would’ve made me hit the door!

Eureka: The biggest thing is not being afraid of straight people. The awkwardness comes from queer people. We’re taught to be afraid of straight people, especially straight men. And when you go into a situation like that with fear, men can smell fear on other men easily. It’s a sign of weakness to them. It’s a way of life and perception and how they decide their dominance. But when you come in, regardless if you’re gay or not, they can still feel the confidence. So I just had to go in confident, knowing who I am and I’m doing shit. Not everyone was jumping up and down but nobody was specifically really rude to me.

Shangela: One of my favorite things was in Twin Falls, Idaho, and we went to a local diner. Eureka and I went early in the morning, and who eats at a diner on a weekday early in the morning? Old people. So here come Eureka and I, fully glittered and ready to rock, into this diner at 10 a.m. in the middle of Idaho. Honestly, it was like a scene from a movie, when you walk in and the forks just hit the table, and then just silence. That’s what it was. But connecting with [them] was actually really fun. They had no clue about drag. When that lady said, “Honey, if it ain’t bull ridin’ or a football, we don’t know what it is!” And when the guy said, “Oh yeah, I know a lot about, um, gays. I have a lot come through my business.” I’m like, “Well what kind of business is it?” He’s like, “Oh, I have a coffee shop.” “Oh, well, gays love coffee!” [Laughs]

Bob: For the most part, most people in these towns were pretty receptive and open. We had a little bit of opposition in a few towns, most people were like, pretty into it. The folks who didn’t like it just kind of minded their own business and didn’t want to tango with us.



Bob : I think we all have a unique place. Drag Race is specifically about the queens, and We’re Here is actually—it’s kind of like, you ever see the movie Little Shop of Horrors?

Bob :You know Little Shop isn’t really, actually about a big talking plant. It’s more about greed and desire and feeling like the little guy. So drag is the package, but We’re Here is not about drag. It’s a show about human connections. It’s a show about queers in small towns. It’s a show about highlighting communities across America that don’t get highlighted.

Eureka: I do think there’s some fierce drag elements throughout it, obviously. But I think it plays more of a part in the search for personal acceptance and equality in general. We’re showing how powerful drag can be, but more so how powerful accepting yourself and being open to exposing yourself without fear. Stop hiding who you are, stop fighting it, stop living in fear.

Shangela: The thing that really got me was, I’m seeing this [town] today but I’m gone in four days. The people that we’re connecting with, our LGBTQ allies and also people here in this community, they see this every day. [Filming We’re Here] reminded me that even though we feel like we made great progress with gay marriage and with visibilty in television and film, we haven’t come that far and we still have a lot of work to do.

172,172,https://weeklyworker.co.uk/worker/1296/sleepwalking-into-disaster/,Sleepwalking into disaster - Weekly Worker,"The government knew for years that a ‘terrifying’ pandemic was coming, says Eddie Ford, yet it did next to nothing to prepare",weeklyworker.co.uk,"The government knew for years that a ‘terrifying’ pandemic was coming, says Eddie Ford, yet it did next to nothing to prepare

With around 130,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and the official death toll of hospital deaths exceeding 18,000, there is growing criticism of the government’s criminally incompetent response to the pandemic. Appearing to have no ‘exit’ strategy or plan worth talking about, Boris Johnson is still hunkered down in his Chequers country retreat. But the criticisms are still coming in - spurred on by a Financial Times analysis of the latest data from the Office for National Statistics, which predicts a “conservative” estimate of 41,102 deaths (April 22). Remember when 20,000 deaths would have been a “good result”?

At the moment the controversy is also centred on the literally life-and-death issue of personal protection equipment for health workers - the fact that an advanced capitalist country like Britain can even be talking about running out of PPE is a damning enough verdict. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, is an increasingly beleaguered figure - his credibility draining away by the day. A survey by the Doctors’ Association UK found that 38% of doctors had no eye protection, 47% did not have long-sleeved gowns, even though they are absolutely essential, and 38% who needed NHS-stipulated FFP3 masks (that can block both liquid and solid aerosols) had no access to them - even though there appeared to be plentiful supplies of them at competitive prices on Amazon , Protective Masks Direct , Dust Masks Direct , etc.

Rachel Reeves, the shadow cabinet office minister, said on the BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that she had been “inundated” with manufacturers who have contacted the government offering to make UK-standard PPE, but had heard nothing back - a situation she called “disgraceful”.

Keir Starmer’s front bench have little trouble combining patriotism with a pro-business stance. But the fact of the matter is that capitalism is by its very nature transnational.

Hence, much to the feigned outrage of Reeves, we have the infectious disease specialists, Landcent, shipping millions of surgical masks to Austria, Italy, Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden. Labour’s narrative is that the government is “prioritising” major fashion and clothing brands like Burberry and Barbour over companies supposedly better placed to deliver what is needed. A dubious proposition. The fact of the matter is that government agents have been signing all manner of highly profitable contracts both here and abroad. The real question, though, is why the UK was so ill-prepared in the first place.

The same goes for testing. Health secretary, Matt Hancock, is coming under intense pressure - having pledged to reach 100,000 tests a day by the end of the month, though it should not be forgotten that Boris Johnson had previously set a target of 250,000 (albeit without putting a date on it). Unfortunately for Hancock, only 19,000 a day were being carried out at the beginning of the week. The Whitehall blame game has started for real, with somebody described as an “anonymous insider close to Downing Street” telling The Daily Telegraph that Hancock’s 100,000 testing target was “made up”. It was an “arbitrary” figure with a “faint irrationality behind it” that would “come back to bite him” - maybe sooner than he would like.

Whilst government officials might still pretend publicly that Hancock’s target is “ambitious but doable”, Dominic Raab repeated the claim this week in the first ever ‘virtual PMQs’. Veiled criticism in recent days of several of the health secretary’s key policy decisions point to wider disagreements - one government figure admitting “mistakes have been made” both on PPE and testing. There is no indication that Britain is anywhere near ready to marry testing with a proper contact-tracing programme of the type that has been extremely successful across some parts of east Asia. A government source grumbled in the Telegraph that “we can’t just flick a switch and carry out millions of tests in the community”, as it is a “logistical nightmare that will take months” - Matt Hancock “should have explained this from the start”, not fed unreasonable expectations.

Meanwhile, there will be no end to the lockdown soon, unless the government takes leave of its senses and irresponsibly starts to lift too many restrictions too quickly. Tom Newton Dunn of The Sun - in some respects a shrewd and reliable commentator - has reported that Downing Street has now banned the term “exit” from its own strategy. Instead, it has simply moved to the “next phase” on May 7, with a “suck it and see” approach to tweaking lockdown measures. The pace will be “very gradual”, according to a Whitehall official, as there are effectively “three different epidemics” right now in Britain - with the virus spreading at different rates in the community, in care homes and in hospitals.

Obviously rattled, key government advisors spent an extraordinarily portion of the weekend writing long, line-by-line rebuttals of highly critical articles that had appeared in The Sunday Times and Financial Times. These were posted on the government’s website without any author credit, although it is rumoured that Boris Johnson had a hand in the process.

The Sunday Times ‘Insight’ team argued, quite correctly, that Britain wasted five weeks before fighting the virus due to chronic mismanagement and an excessive focus on Brexit at the very top of the agenda. The complaint was that when the paper criticised the government for allowing 279,000 items of protective equipment to be sent from the UK to China in the early days of the outbreak, it had failed to point out that 12 million items had since come back in the other direction. However, showing a less than impressive standard of journalism, one of those quoted in the government’s rebuttal was Richard Horton - editor of the prestigious Lancet medical journal. Horton himself is now rebutting the rebuttal, accusing the government of “deliberately rewriting history in its ongoing Covid-19 disinformation campaign”.

As for the FT piece about a plan to get private companies to design and build new models of ventilators, government ministers were angered by the suggestion that these firms were confused as to the brief, and that little progress was being made - the UK’s target to secure 30,000 having being downgraded to 18,000, but even that figure has still not been met. Having said that, despite original fears, there has so far not been a shortage of these complex machines - let us hope it stays that way.

But rather than five wasted weeks, it is more like five wasted years - which has turned out to be fatal. In 2016 there was Exercise Cygnus, predicated on the scenario of a pandemic originating in south-east Asia, with a virus similar to H2N2 influenza, which like Covid-19, causes deadly respiratory illness in patients. The scenario envisaged was that after the first cases of the virus had been reported two months earlier, the infection then arrived a month later in the UK via a group of travellers. Under this ‘war-game’, the virus had not yet reached its peak, but the NHS was already “about to fall over” - completely overwhelmed by the pandemic with mortuaries overflowing. The results were deemed “too terrifying” to publish - must not upset the children – and, more to the point, next to nothing was done to prepare the UK for such a pandemic, even though everyone knew it was only a matter of time before some mutated virus struck.

Of course, this exercise was conducted when the then health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, was busily cutting the number of NHS beds. No wonder that in an interview with the BBC he said he did not want to play the “blame game” - especially as he bears no small responsibility for the unnecessary deaths that have arisen through failing to act on the results of Exercise Cygnus. The Sunday Times was right when it talked about the government “sleepwalking into disaster”."

A panel of experts in the oncology discussed what their health care teams are learning throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, during the Community Oncology Association (COA) 2020 Conference on Thursday.

 

 The virtual panel included Sibel Blau, MD, medical director of Northwest Medical Specialties; Steve D’Amato, BScPharm, chief executive officer of New England Cancer Specialist;, Jeffrey Patton, MD, chief executive officer and medical oncologist at the Tennessee Oncology; Alti Rahman, MHA, MBA, CSSBB, practice administrator at the Oncology Consultant; and Anthony Scalzo, MD, president of the Hematology Oncology Associates of CNY.

 

 Blau explained that after the first death occurred in Seattle, her health system gathered a team of viral illness taskforce members to implement measures by March 1. “We have a very good leadership and a robust team. This had to be the fastest, and the most rapidly changing [plan] that we’ve ever implemented. It was an extremely fast change,” she said.

 

 D’Amato mentioned that operational changes to keep staff and patients safe, and a strong leadership team was essential. Additionally, effective communication was critical for the team. Their journey started in early March, and the leadership team had up to 2 calls a day to ramp up operational changes.

 

 “I think that’s the beauty of all of the practices that are in COA. Despite how large we are, we are really motivated to be flexible and change quickly,” D’Amato said. He also mentioned that as a nation, the system was not prepared for the COVID-19 pandemic.

 

 “When we look at what happened with the public health system, and how woefully unprepared it was to deal with this crisis, was a hard lesson for me to learn,” said Scalzo.

 

 Telemedicine was the forefront of the conversation, as experts like D’Amato mentioned that not only was workload one of the biggest implementation successes, but a radicalization for their clinics going past the COVID-19 pandemic.

 

 “Telehealth certainly came to the forefront and we implemented that in 4 days. A lot of work went into operationalizing telehealth. Certainly, team communication as we moved a lot of our staff remotely—about 50% of our staff was remote—as I mentioned earlier communications was key. So having those teams communicate on a daily basis to make sure all the patient issues it taken care of and coordinated I really was critical,” said D’Amato.

 

 Telemedicine has been helpful for physicians, according to Blau. “It's provided us this great patient care and in the ways that we never thought before we knew telemedicine exist in some states were able to use it. It improves patient care in the ways that we couldn't have imagined. For example, we are able to see a patient do a consultation and bring a patient's family members from different parts of the country into the conversation,” said Blau.

 

 She also mentioned that survivorship was a great support and the ability to see a patients’ needs as well.

 

 The experts also discussed the new challenges of working remotely effectively. For example, they said, improvements to the nation’s communication networks are needed in order for workers to rely on digital tools for their jobs.

The Patriots really did struggle offensively in 2019 but still managed to win 12 games on the back of their defense and favorable schedule which saw them really play the lower tier of the league. The loss of Tom Brady in theory should have an impact however it seems like there is a lot of faith in Bill Belichick and his system to put the Patriots in strong position to repeat as AFC East Champions for the 12th straight season. Replacing Brady appears to be second-year quarterback Jared Stidham, but the team did sign Brian Hoyer who is very familiar with how to run the Patriots offense given that this will be his third stint with the organization after being released last offseason. There is also a chance the Patriots make a play for Cam Newton if you are to trust Vegas as they list the Patriots as the odds favorite for the recently released QB.

The Patriots offense will head into the year with a healthy offensive line which is something they never had last year and both Julian Edelman and Mohammed Sanu should also be recovered from their injuries. Second-year receivers N’Keal Harry and Jakobi Meyers should also figure to contribute in the offense this year, especially if Stidham is at the helm as he demonstrated better chemistry with the duo during the preseason last year and likely will have more tolerance during the year than Brady demonstrated last season with the two then rookie receivers.

On defense the Patriots re-signed both McCourty brothers while also signing Pro Bowl safety Adrian Phillips to bolster an elite secondary that is anchored by 2019 Defensive Player of the Year Stephon Gilmore . At linebacker the team took a hit with Kyle Van Noy , Jamie Collins and Elandon Roberts signing elsewhere in free agency but rotating linebackers is something the Patriots have had plenty of success within past seasons.

In all likelihood the Patriots will take a step back this season, how far of a step back is the question. Many will point out that Belichick went 11-5 with Matt Cassel l back in 2008 and went 4-1 with Jimmy Garoppolo and Jacoby Brissett during Brady’s suspension in 2016 but both of those teams were stacked with the latter going on to win the Super Bowl and the former coming off an 18-1 season. The roster heading into this year certainly has its questions and for that reason I do not believe they win the AFC East. As for their win total I would love to bet the number as I think they finish 9-7. This of course would all change if the team does in fact end up with Cam Newton as I would expect both the Vegas odds and team win totals to be adjusted.

This is going to be the popular bet for the AFC East as the Bills shocked everyone in 2019 by going 10-6 and making the playoffs. With Tom Brady no longer in the division many will feel that the top spot is open for the taking and Buffalo made a big splash this offseason by trading for wide receiver Stefon Diggs . Diggs comes over from Minnesota after posting back-to-back 1,000-yard seasons while totaling 15 touchdowns during that span. He will further the legitimacy of the Bills receiving group but to be effective the team will need Josh Allen to take that next step in his development. In year two, Allen completed just 58.5-percent of his passes for 3,089 yards. The Bills offense was again centered around a strong running game which was largely led by Allen himself who ran for 510 yards and nine touchdowns. Adding a receiver of Diggs caliber could be a sign that the team is looking to open things up a bit more and utilize the cannon of an arm that Allen posses with hopes his accuracy continues to grow. The team’s defense added edge rusher Mario Addison to a three-year deal after four straight seasons of at least nine sacks.

In 2019, Buffalo was 0-2 against the Patriots and 3-3 overall against the AFC East. With Brady no longer in New England it is reasonable to think Buffalo can at least split the season series while taking advantage of the rest of the weaker AFC East competition. My pick here is Buffalo to win the AFC East and I will take the OVER of 8.5 wins.

You can scoff here as much as you want but few teams finished the 2019 season better than the Miami Dolphins who went 5-1 over the final six games of the season with Ryan Fitzpatrick at QB which included a win over the Patriots in New England. Miami started off the year 0-7 but after jettisoning some of the malcontents and deciding to stick with Fitzpatrick over the struggling Josh Rosen it appeared as if the Dolphins roster started to buy into the program of rookie head coach Brian Flores. Miami is set to have Fitzpatrick under center again in 2020 and they added to the offense by signing free agent running back Jordan Howard to help bolster a running game that was almost non-existent for most of 2019. The team also signed both Kyle Van Noy and Elandon Roberts from New England as both will join their former defensive coordinator in Miami. What’s even more appealing is that in the 2020 NFL Draft the Dolphins have three first-round picks (5,18,26) and two second-round picks (39,56) to add to their roster. Sure, they will be rookies, but that is a lot of what has the potential to be impact talent being added to their roster.

If you like the long shot bets, then getting Miami at +1000 given the state of the AFC East right now is probably not the worst investment. I would also take the over six wins as I do think the Dolphins will be better this year as head coach Brian Flores starts to shape the team the Dolphins hired him to re-build.

Off all the team’s in the AFC East the Jets are the only team which Vegas has the win total favorite as the under so let that settle in. So far this offseason the Jets have added some depth along their offensive line and signed Breshad Perriman to replace Roby Anderson as I previously mentioned. The roster is still lacking talent at the receiver position and defenses do not respect the passing attack enough to allow Le’Veon Bell to do much of anything. The Jets were 2-4 in the AFC East last season as they split the season series with the Bills and Dolphins while losing both games to New England. Though, again, the AFC East is considered to be more up for grabs this year it would seem unlikely the Jets are the team that is going to take that leap forward.

I am going to pass on the +700 and the under seven wins certainly seems appealing as I am expected the Bills and Dolphins to be better this year and I am unsure if New York can sweep a season series against the Patriots even if it is Jared Stidham or Brian Hoyer at quarterback.

The Titans shocked everyone by upsetting both the New England Patriots and the Baltimore Ravens to reach the AFC Championship game in 2019. The Titans offense was led by running back Derrick Henry and quarterback Ryan Tannehill who took over as the starter during the middle of the season and finished, completing 70-percent of his passes with 22 touchdowns and six interceptions. This offseason the Titans were very much in the hunt for Tom Brady but ultimately decided to stick with Tannehill and reward him with a contract extension. The team also franchise tagged running back Derrick Henry who they will lean on heavily again in 2020. The Titans will have a tougher schedule come 2020 as they face off against the AFC North and the NFC North with road games against Baltimore, Green Bay and Minnesota. They also face the Buffalo Bills who should pose a tougher test as well.

I lean with Vegas here and would expect the Titans to take this division as head coach Mike Vrable enters year-three as the team’s head coach. Despite the tougher schedule, I do they the team also hits the over on the team win total at +100.

The Colts finished 2019 with a 7-9 record and to be honest, it should have been better if not for injuries sustained to top playmakers T.Y. Hilton , Marlon Mack and QB Jacoby Brissett who all missed time. This offseason the Colts decided to make a change at the quarterback position and signed veteran Philip Rivers to replace Brissett. Rivers threw for 4,615 yards with 23 touchdowns and 20 interceptions while completing 66-percent of his passes last season. By joining the Colts, we should see Rivers improve the team’s downfield passing attack but it’s worth noting that he will turn 39 years old during the season, so the possibility of a decline is worth considering.

Though Vegas has the Titans as odds favorite to win the division they do have the Colts right behind them at +175 while actually having the OVER as the favorite for the Colts win total of eight while the Titans had the UNDER as the Vegas favorite for their win total of nine. To me there are good odds here at +175 to take the Colts as the division winner.

The Texans kicked off the new league year with a shocker as they traded wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins to the Cardinals for running back David Johnson . Hopkins is an All-Pro receiver, coming off a season where he caught 104 passes for 1,165 yards and seven scores over 15 games. To fill the void the Texans then went and traded for Rams receiver Brandin Cooks . The trade of Hopkins leaves the Texans with likes of Cooks, Will Fuller , Kenny Stills and Keke Coutee as the primary receivers. The acquisition of David Johnson will also help with the passing attack as he offers up elite pass catching skills, but injuries and poor play have really put a hamper on Johnson’s career after he exploded in 2016. There have been rumors that head coach Bill O’Brien has issues with some of his players and we have seen some questionable play calling from the coach in big moments that have cost the team.

The Texans are without a first-round pick in the upcoming draft and will not pick until the second round where they should look to help their defensive but could also look to bolster the team’s receiving group to appease quarterback Deshaun Watson . +225 to win the division is better odds than I would have given them but considering every team in this division does have some blemishes I could see the final standings coming down to a game or two. I would venture to think the Texans can eclipse the eight-win mark as well but at -110 I would let it be.

Quite the fall from grace for the Jaguars who were in the AFC Championship game back in 2018 led by the running game of Leonard Fournette and the “Sacksonville” defense. Unfortunately, they blew a second half lead to the Patriots and the team never recovered as they dealt away most of their defense and will now have their third starting quarterback in three years with Gardner Minshew under-center. There is almost no shot at Jacksonville winning this division baring total deterioration of the three team is ranked ahead of them or Minshew taking a tremendous leap in year-two. That being said, I do think +115 at OVER 5.5 wins could be worth a play.

The Ravens went 14-2 and took the No.1 seed in the AFC last season behind the explosion of Lamar Jackson who silenced critics from the get and finished with an MVP worthy season in which he completed 66.1-percent of his passes with 36 touchdowns and six interceptions while adding 1,206 yards and seven touchdowns on the ground. Baltimore’s only two losses during the regular season came against the Chiefs and Browns during Weeks 3 and 4. After that they rattled off 12 straight wins before suffering an upset loss in the playoffs to the Tennessee Titans. Given the state of the NFC North it seems unlikely, barring injury or serious regression from Lamar Jackson , that they do not run away with this division yet again. You can lock in two wins against the Bengals with ease. After that you have a Steelers team that will still have questions at QB with Big Ben another year older and coming off major surgery and a Browns team that has yet to live up to the hype and will have yet another new head coach to start the season making it three in three seasons.

Lock in the Ravens at -200 and I will even go with the over 11.5 wins here which is marked at just -105 with Vegas suggesting the under as the more likely scenario.

Look, the talent is theoretically here on offense and at times it flashes elite potential. In 2019 the coach Freddie Kitchens made some mind-boggling decisions which did more harm than good but that is not to let the players off the hook. The facts are simple. We saw better performances from Baker Mayfield in his commercials than we did from him on the actual football field and if Cleveland is ever going to be anything that is going to have to change. In his sophomore season Mayfield completed just 59.4-percent of his passes with 22 touchdowns and 21 interceptions. No team entered 2019 with more hype after the Browns went out and acquired Odell Beckham Jr. following their strong finish to 2018. Unfortunately, OBJ did not quite click as he dealt with an injury for most of the year. 2020 gives the Browns a big shot at redemption as the offense added yet another weapon in Austin Hooper to replace the inconsistent David Njoku at tight end. The team still has an elite backfield duo with Nick Chubb and Kareem Hunt and oh yeah Jarvis Landry and the aforementioned OBJ have not gone anywhere. If Mayfield can live up to his own hype, then this team can put up points and compete.

Of any other team in this division I would throw a few bones here at +450. If I was forced to bet the win total, I would also take the over, but I think this team is destined to be a 9-7 or 7-9 type of team.

There is just something about the Steelers that does not do it for me. To me they are not any better than the Browns when push comes to shove and you get the Browns at better odds. Mike Tomlin has been public that he expects Ben Roethlisberger to be ready to go for Week 1 but what is that going to look like? He is a 38-year old QB coming off major elbow surgery. I do not imagine that turning out too well. Behind Big Ben is Mason Rudolph who is also coming off surgery and was very mediocre in replacing Roethlisberger last season. I know Pittsburgh still managed to win games last season as they finished 8-8 and Vegas is likely assuming the return of Roethlisberger would put the team back in contention, but I am not buying it. Take the under on the win total at -120.

This would be one of the unlikeliest scenarios in all of sports but hey crazier things have happened right? The Bengals are in a prime position for the mere fact that they are sitting with the No.1 overall pick in the draft this season and are expected to take Joe Burrow with that selection. The success of an NFL franchise is largely impacted by the level of play at the quarterback position. If Burrow comes into the league and lights it up, then the ceiling this team can reach will be greater. Cinci still has an elite running back in Joe Mixon and receivers Tyler Boyd and A.J. Green are expected to be ready to go for the start of the year. I would consider an over bet on the 5.5 wins.

The Chiefs battled through quite the 2019 season as injuries to Patrick Mahomes and Tyreek Hill but ultimately the team’s pure talent was able to overcome those injuries as they managed to still win 12 games and the AFC West. Oh yeah, they also went on to win the Super Bowl and spoiler alert, they are the favorites to win the Super Bowl again.

Facts here are easy to see, they have the best young QB in the game, no disrespect to the MVP Lamar Jackson , an explosive offense with Tyreek Hill and Travis Kelce leading the way and a pretty solid head coach despite the grief that he takes in Andy Reid. They play in a division that has a few teams potentially on the come in the Denver Broncos and Las Vegas Raiders but both of those seem unlikely to be actual challenges and a Los Angeles Chargers team that is committing to TyRod Taylor at QB which is a show we have seen plenty of times before and rarely has it ended well.

It is an easy bet to make and thus the -300 odds. The -120 on the over 11.5 wins is something I think we can swing as well. I expect to see the Chiefs in the AFC Championship game come seasons end with a possible repeat in the works.

So, Vegas have deemed the remaining three teams in the AFC West to essentially be a coinflip for who will division second, third and fourth behind the Chiefs. All three teams have +800 odds to win the division with individual team win totals set at 7.5. However, the team totals are where we can see who Vegas is actually giving the edge to in how they project the standings to play out and that is the Broncos second, Chargers third and Raiders third. Let us break it down:

The Broncos will have second year QB Drew Lock under center to begin the year after selecting him in the second-round in 2019. Lock made five starts as a rookie, going 4-1 while completing 64.1-percent of his passes for 1,020 yards with seven touchdowns and three interceptions. At receiver the position Courtland Sutton will look to build upon his breakout 2019 season but the depth behind him is more than questionable with the likes of DaeSean Hamilton and Tim Patrick currently slated as starters. I would expect Denver to address this position in the draft while also hoping tight end Noah Fant takes a big leap. The running game is going to be a feature of the Broncos offense as the team signed Melvin Gordon to join Phillip Lindsay and Royce Freeman . If Lock truly takes the next step then I can see taking the over 7.5 wins here but I’d like to really see another receiver opposite of Sutton.

Though the story of the offseason was whether or not Tom Brady was going to leave New England it should not have been lost that Philip Rivers leaving the Chargers is a pretty big deal. The question once the two committed to parting ways was who would be the man to come in replace Rivers at the position. Brady was rumored but eventually he signed with the Buccaneers. Though the likes of Jameis Winston and Cam Newton are still free agents the Chargers have come out and said the man replacing Rivers will be the man who backed him up last year in TyRod Taylor . Taylor has been around the block a few times with his most recent play coming with Cleveland in 2018 where he struggled and found himself replaced by Baker Mayfield after three starts. Prior to playing in Cleveland he started three seasons in Buffalo where he finished with a 22-20 record while completing 62.6-percent of his passes with 51 touchdowns and 16 interceptions while averaging 201 yards per game. Taylors value really comes from his mobility as he averaged 525 yards and nearly five rushing touchdowns per season. Taylor can certainly create some plays, but he isn’t nearly the passer that Rivers was even at the end of his career there in Los Angles. The Chargers also moved on from Melvin Gordon and will focus on again using Austin Ekeler after he exploded for 557 yards rushing while adding 92 catches for 993 yards receiving. Justin Jackson will serve as the back-up, but I would expect the Chargers to also address the position in the draft. At receiver they franchised tight end Hunter Henry and have both Keenan Allen and Mike Williams healthy and ready to contribute, though again, Taylor under center could very well lead to reduced production from the team’s receivers. Vegas still gives the Chargers a positive outlook on their win total, though also 7.5 the line is -120 for them to hit the over making it the favorite bet.

Though moving to Las Vegas the home team gets no love from the odds makers who has their 7.5 team win total sitting at -110 for the under and the over which makes them a true coin flip however they are the only team in the division with negative odds to hit the under. The Raiders have made a few moves on the offensive side of the ball but little that really jumps out as a true improvement. At receiver Nelson Agholor was signed and he figures to be one of the team’s starting outside receiver to go opposite of Tyrell Williams and slot receiver Hunter Renfrow. Injuries of course were an issue with the Raiders last season with running back Josh Jacobs and Darren Waller recovering from offseason surgery and Williams working his way back from plantar fasciitis which plagued him most of last season. At quarterback the team was rumored to be in on Tom Brady but lost out and will have Derek Carr under center once again but with Marcus Mariota as his back up after the team signed the former Titans QB during free agency. There is certainly some potential here if Carr can manage the game while Josh Jacobs carries the offense but baring a season ending injury to Mahomes there is little shot at the Raiders taking the division and the odds just are not good enough to place a bet on their win total in my opinion.

The Eagles won the division in 2019 going 9-7 and that itself was a feat as the team was decimated by injury throughout the season, most notably at the wide receiver position which saw a returning DeSean Jackson play just three games while Alshon Jeffery was hobbled most of the year and was only able to suit up for 10 games. Carson Wentz was throwing to the likes of Nelson Agholor , Greg Ward and Mack Hollins at receiver while defenses looked to lock up tight ends Zach Ertz and Dallas Goedert . The team’s running attack began the year with Jordan Howard leading the way but soon rookie Miles Sanders took the lead and finished with 818 yards rushing while adding 50 catches for 509 yards which was good for third most on the team. Philly took the division by a game over the Cowboys but it certainly did not need to be that close and it took a four game winning streak to end the season to lock it up while the Cowboys themselves fell down the stretch.

In 2020 Vegas has the Eagles as an even money play to win the division and has the over 9.5-win mark as the betting favorite. We have seen this team consistently under-achieve in my opinion and the injury history with Carson Wentz certainly will make them a risky pick in my opinion.

To be honest, Dallas should have won this division in 2019. They had the better talent on paper but between coaching and just lack of effort it seemed at times resulted in some losses that just should not have happened like the Jets in Week 6, the Bears in Week 14 and the Eagles in Week 16. Now, I know all three of those games were on the road, but they were winnable games that the team could not finish. The disappointing finish lead to Jason Garrett being let go as head coach and Mike McCarthy being hired to replace him. The team also re-signed WR Amari Cooper and franchised QB Dak Prescott to solidify the offense. They also signed kicker Greg Zuerlein who can be a major asset in the kicking game. On the defensive side the team made some splashes as they signed safety Ha Ha Clinton-Dix , defensive tackle Gerald McCoy , defensive tackle Dontari Poe and just recently linked to embattled linebacker Aldon Smith to a one-year deal.

Of the two teams I would much rather the +125 on Dallas to win the division. We are even getting +105 on the over 9.5 wins which also is not a bad take.

Maybe I’m drinking the Kool-Aid a bit here but the Giants at +900 to win the NFC East is something I’m drawn to as a nice longshot bet. Listen, I understand the team went 4-12 last season, but they had a rookie QB under center and were without Saquon Barkley for a chunk of the year. Those were not the only injuries the team suffered either as tight end Evan Engram was limited to just eight games and wide receiver Sterling Shepard to ten games. Who I just named, in theory, are the top three skill position players on the Giants roster. Not much for a rookie QB to work with and while sure there was some nice stories with Darius Slay ton emerging and Golden Tate looking solid after his suspension, it was clear the direction the team was heading. Even Daniel Jones dealt with injury which forced Eli Manning , who was benched after a poor start to the year, to start a few games at the end.

In the upcoming NFL Draft the Giants have the No.4 overall pick with many mocks suggesting that they could land the top overall player in defensive end Chase Young. Defense is certainly a position the Giants need help and Young should be an immediate impact player off the edge. There is also some speculation that the Giants are opening to trading out of the No.4 spot to acquire assets which would prove to be quite a haul and would most certainly include multiple picks in the current year’s draft. With new head coach Joe Judge running the ship he will look to bring what he learned from his eight seasons on the Patriots coaching staff to New York.

So, if I am betting the Giants to win the division this is what I am looking for to happen here. First, the offense stays healthy and supports second-year QB Daniel Jones as he continues to develop in a new system with a new head coach. Second, the Giants defense improves with the potential drafting of Chase Young and the free agent signing James Bradberry at corner who will be looked upon to anchor the secondary after signing a big money deal. Finally, the Eagles and Cowboys will continue to under-achieve. With the Cowboys having a new head coach it is not inconceivable that there are some growing pains here. With the Eagles, it is hard not to look at the injury history of the key players on their roster and wonder if they can keep it together for a full season. All that comes together, and we could very well see the G-Men at the top.

See, the +900 does not look that bad after all does it?

I think bringing in Ron Rivera is certainly a step in the right direction, and we saw flashes from Dwayne Haskins that caught your attention but ultimately, they are still ways away. A healthy Derrius Guice would be nice to see, and few stories in 2019 were better than breakout rookie receiver Terry McLaurin who would finish with 58 catches for 919 yards and seven scores. While there could certainly be some upside here it won’t be enough to see the Skins at the top of the division come seasons end.

The Saints went 13-3 in 2019 as they ran away with the NFC South, owning the only winning record in the division. Drew Brees only appeared in 11 games due to injury, but he was stellar in those 11 games, throwing for 2,979 yards with 27 touchdowns and just four interceptions while owning a league-best 74.3-percent completion percentage. There was some question this offseason as to whether or not Brees was going to hang it up but the now 41-year-old QB agreed to return to the team. The Saints offense is well balanced with Alvin Kamara and Latavius Murray in the backfield and Michael Thomas leading the league with 149 catches and 1,725 yards. To help bolster the passing attack the Saints were able to sign Emmanuel Sanders and he will slot in as the No.2 receiver which is something the Saints have really lacked.

Vegas has the Saints as a +100 favorite to win the division with -140 odds on the over 10 wins. If I was making a play here I think the division is still the Saints to lose even with the Buccaneers being everyone's favorite bet now that Brady and Gronk are there and since I think they win the division you might as well throw some money on the OVER 10 wins as well.

The Buccaneers went 7-9 last season with six of their nine losses finishing within seven points of the opponent. Why is that significant? Well, for one, it showed that the team played in some competitive ball games but also one has to think that Jameis Winston and his 30 interceptions likely played a hand in at least a few of those losses. The turnovers not only kill any momentum the offense is building but also strains the defense who is constantly going back on the field. In total, Winston had 39 turnovers while totaling just 34 touchdowns. That is not what you are looking for. The Buccaneers agreed and moved on from Winston this offseason and signed Tom Brady in free agency…. Yes, THAT Tom Brady . After 20-years in New England, Brady will be donning a new jersey. Now, Brady certainly isn’t the man he once was, but he still makes the right decisions with the football and will make better than bad football plays when on the field. Tampa then went and shocked everyone by trading for Rob Gronkowski in a move that can only help the Bucs offense. 2019 was a down year for Brady as the Patriots offense was often injured but he still threw for 24 touchdowns with just eight interceptions. The Buccaneers will give Brady a ton of weapons as well with Gronk, Mike Evans , Chris Godwin , O.J. Howard , and Cameron Brate .

While the focus is going to be on how the offense looks, I don’t think you should sleep on this Tampa defense either who was strong at times and should benefit from not having to be on the field as often. At +140 this is certainly a good bet and I think the OVER on the 9 wins is something we should be looking at as well.

It’s quite possible that Super Bowl LI broke the Atlanta Falcons. Yes, the team made some coaching and personnel changes since then but since that Super Bowl loss to the Patriots the team has gone 10-6, 7-9 and 7-9. Matt Ryan had an okay year in 2019, throwing for 4,466 yards with 26 touchdowns and 14 interceptions. The team’s running game was almost non-existent, and the defense was among the worst in the league. Julio Jones and Calvin Ridley were solid as was Austin Hooper but Hooper is now in Cleveland. To replace Hooper the Falcons traded for Hayden Hurst and to help the running attack the team signed Todd Gurley . The defense could still use some work, but they did sign Dante Fowler to help the pass rush.

Figuring that Buccaneers are going to be better this season I find it hard to think the Falcons have enough to overcome both the Bucs and Saints to take the division so while +600 is enticing I will have to pass there. OVER 7.5 wins at -125 is not awful but still not exactly the bet odds in my opinion.

The Panthers had a wild offseason which started with Luke Kuechly retiring and finished with the release of Cam Newton . In between, they lost cornerback James Bradberry and defensive linemen Mario Addison as well which further hurts the team’s defense. To replace Cam Newton the Panthers signed Teddy Bridgewater to a three-year deal to be their next QB. Bridgewater is a fine game manager but lacks the explosiveness that Newton brought to the table. With Bridgewater under-center, we should expect to see even more Christian McCaffrey while the likes of D.J. Moore and Curtis Samuel may take some hits due to the lack of downfield passing. That said, Bridgewater is a very accurate QB that can live with the intermediate throws.

Carolina is a long shot for a reason, I would not even make a lottery ticket bet to have them win the division. Vegas odds favor the under 5.5 wins and that is hard to dispute as I would be surprised if they win a division game this year.

The Packers may have had an easy draw schedule wise in 2019 but 2020 will be on a bit of a different level with the NFC North playing the NFC and AFC South divisions. By finishing 13-3 the Packers also draw the 49ers and Eagles to fill out their schedule as the other division winners from last year. The NFC South this year added Tom Brady to the Buccaneers, not sure if you heard that news or not and of course it still has the Drew Brees led Saints while the AFC South has the Texans, Titans and Colts who should all pose tougher tests.

The Packers passing attack really struggled following the injury to Davante Adams and the team has done little to address the receiver position after Adams in terms of adding any key players. Sure, Devin Funchess can be a big endzone presence but let us get real here, it is still Devin Funchess . The running game thrived under Aaron Jones and though Aaron Rodgers still look strong at age 36 it does make sense for the Packers offense to again feature the run to open up the passing game when viable.

For me the telling sign here is that Vegas is giving you the same odds on the Packers win total of 9.5 wins. They too are not sure where to go. I think it’s likely always a decent play to get plus-money on the Packers to win the NFC North so maybe a small play at +125 is worth it but I won’t touch that win total.

Minnesota made a big move this offseason and maybe not for the best by trading away Stefon Diggs to the Buffalo Bills for draft picks. Both parties had been at odds with one another for more than a season with trade rumors swirling and Diggs being passive aggressive with his social media postings. That said, Diggs was the team’s leading receiver in 2019 and had posted back-to-back 1,000-yard seasons. Dalvin Cook had a huge 2019 but once again fell to injury late in the injury as he played just 14 regular season games. He finished with 1,135 yards rushing while adding another 519 yards receiving. At quarterback Kirk Cousins completed 69.1-percent of his passes but threw for just 3,603 yards with 26 touchdowns and six interceptions. There were issues early in the year with both Diggs and receiver Adam Thielen commenting on there early struggles of Cousins and the team’s lack of a passing attack. Thielen, for his own cause, appeared in 10 games due to a hamstring injury.

The 2020 outlook is uninspiring. The team signed Tajae Sharpe to add depth at receiver but seem like they will go into the year with Thielen and Bisi Johnson at receiver unless they add a playmaker in the draft. Dalvin Cook will again be asked to shoulder the load but with his injury history that will certainly put some questions on the table. The Vikings defense last season struggled and will be counted on to bounce back, especially in the secondary.

Vegas is favoring the UNDER on the win total of nine at -120. I think they could very easily be a 9-7 team here, but Kirk Cousins isn’t a QB that is going to win you games and it seems like they have taken a step back on offense here with risk at running back. I am out on the Vikings.

We saw a step back in year two of the Matt Nagy era in Chicago as the Bears finished 8-8 after winning the division with a 12-4 record in 2018. There was much hope for another division title as Chicago was backed by an elite defense and a QB in Mitch Trubisky that had put together a solid sophomore season. The Bears also drafted running back David Montgomery in the third round and may figure his ability to be a three-down back would be utilized by Nagy given how he used Kareem Hunt during his tenure in Kansas City. Unfortunately, nothing went right for the Bears in 2019 as the offense struggled mightily. Trubisky regressed and the offensive play calling was under much scrutiny. Receiver Allen Robinson had a big season, catching 98 passes for 1,147 yards and seven scores but there was little secondary threat opposite of him. The team’s defense remained strong, finishing fourth in points allowed and eighth in total yards allowed on the season.

It’s the Bears defense that has me intrigued at their +300 mark. I also like that they went and traded for Nick Foles to compete for the starting quarterback job with Trubisky. Injury forced Foles to have a lost season in Jacksonville last year but the Bears were willing to take on his contract to acquire him so it would not shock me to see him starting in Week 1. Chicago will need to get better on the offensive line after struggling last season but I feel as though Nagy is ready to reset and we saw last year that you can win in this league by having a game manager at QB, a strong running game and an elite defense. Give me the +300 on the division winner and the +100 on the OVER 8.5 wins.

Injuries really crashed the Lions 2019 season but, not many figured them to be big movers anyhow. The team is better than 3-12-1 when they have a healthy Matt Stafford and Kerryon Johnson but the defense again struggled and Matt Patricia has yet to find his footing as an NFL coach and if you believe the reports around the league it does not sound like people like playing hard for the guy either. If you want some highlights to 2019 for the Lions, then Kenny Golladay is about all you got. He broke out for a career best 65 catches for 1,190 yards and 11 scores despite the fact that he had Jeff Driskel and David Blough throwing him the football for half the season.

Few teams were as active in free agency as the Lions were as they prepare for the 2020 season. The team traded away corner Darius Slay but signed Desmond Trufant to replace him. Patricia also signed two former Patriot players in Danny Shelton and Jamie Collins while trading for another in safety Duron Harmon . On the offensive side they brought in receiver Geronimo Allison and signed former Eagles offensive linemen Halapoulivaati Vaitai to a five-year deal.

With good health that Lions should certainly be better than the 2019 version that took the field. I think they could even hit the OVER on the 6.5 wins at +105 but at +900 to win the division, that is more of a dart throw.

It makes total sense that the 49ers are the current Vegas favorites to win the NFC West as they are not only the defending NFC West champions but also the NFC champions after making it to the Super Bowl last season before falling to the Kansas City Chiefs. The Niners are returning most of their team and more importantly will get another year for Jimmy Garoppolo to develop under Kyle Shanahan’s offense. Jimmy G was largely a game manager during the regular season and was an afterthought during the playoff run as the team used the running game almost exclusively at times to score and kill the clock. That said, Garoppolo still finished the year with a very solid 69.1-percent completion rate and a QB rating of 102.0. The running game will continue to be instrumental and there is plenty of talent in that backfield between Raheem Mostert , Tevin Coleman , Matt Breida and Jerick McKinnon . Though Emmanuel Sanders left in free agency, Deebo Samuel showed he is capable of being the No.2 target for Jimmy G behind tight end George Kittle .

If you place the bet to win at -125 no one will blame you but I think there is something to be said about the UNDER being the odds favorite on the team’s win total of 10.5. Personally, I’m not on the 49ers to repeat.

Seattle is a perennial playoff team and finished 2019 with a 11-5 record. Injuries hampered the Seahawks down the stretch as they were forced to sign Marshawn Lynch out of retirement after Chris Carson and Rashaad Penny suffered season ending injuries. The team also lost emerging tight end Will Dissly to a season ending injury and mid-season pick-up Josh Gordon was unsurprisingly suspended for violating the league’s substance abuse policy. Russell Wilson once again put the team on his shoulders to have another MVP caliber season as he completed 66.1-percent of his passes with 31 touchdowns and five interceptions. Tyler Lockett lead the team in receiving with 1,057 yards but it was rookie D.K. Metcalf that surprised as he finished with 58 catches for 900 yards and seven scores.

At +350 I think the Seahawks may be my favorite futures bet of any team. I also like that Vegas has the OVER of their nine wins as the favorite, especially since Vegas has the UNDER as the win total favorite for the 49ers who are supposed to win this division. Take the +350 and trust in Russell Wilson and the Seahawks in 2020.

The Cardinals made the biggest splash of the offseason as they traded away David Johnson to the Houston Texans and in return landed DeAndre Hopkins . Hopkins gives last year’s No.1 overall pick Kyler Murray a legit weapon to target as often a possible in the Kliff Kingsbury pass happy offense. Murray finished his rookie season throwing for 3,722 yards with 20 touchdowns and 12 interceptions while completing 64.4-percent of his passes. The mobile Murray also added 544 yards and four scores on the ground as well. At running back the team acquired Kenyan Drake from the Dolphins last season and Drake thrived. The team brought Drake back which opened the door for the team’s trade of David Johnson to Houston for Hopkins. Drake has the ability to both run and catch which made him productive piece of the Cardinals offense. Opposite of Hopkins will be Christian Kirk who missed a few games due to injury and the ageless Larry Fitzgerald who decided to come back for another season.

Hey, it’s definitely a long shot play here but at +700 the odds are certainly appealing. The Cardinals could and should have a high scoring offense this year and the defense isn’t too awful either. Vegas has the OVER 7.5 wins as the favorite at -120 so it’s not unreasonable to think they could make a play for the top of the division if the 49ers and Seahawks falter at all.

To me they got exposed during their Super Bowl run a few years ago and the blueprint to slowing down this offense was put on film and that resulted in some big time struggles for Jared Goff who completed just 62.9-percent of his passes with 22 touchdowns and 16 interceptions. The team moved on from Todd Gurley this offseason as well and announced they will use a committee approach at the position. At receiver the team is still loaded with Cooper Kupp and Robert Woods to lead the way and Tyler Higgbee looking to build upon his finish to 2019 but again, I question if Goff can rebound from such a down year.

Vegas has the UNDER nine wins as a big favorite at -135 so I see no reason to even attempt to place a bet on their +400 odds to win the division.

The AFC was won by the eventual Super Bowl winners in the Kansas City Chiefs in 2019 so it should be no shock to see the Chiefs listed as the favorites to repeat as conference champions once again. The benefit however of betting the Chiefs to win the conference instead of just winning their division is the ROI you get on your bet. We saw the Chiefs listed at -300 to win the West meaning you have to bet $300 to win $100. However, to win the AFC championship the Chiefs are listed at +350 which nets you $350 on a bet of $100. The AFC West division did not get any better in 2020 and as long as there is good health here, I would find it hard to envision the Chiefs not in the conference title game once again.

Hard not to like Baltimore here at +400 as they have the reigning NFL MVP in Lamar Jackson and a strong defense to help shut down opponents. Like the Chiefs, the Ravens will benefit from playing in an average-at-best division in the AFC North. This should allow for them to build up a solid record, likely land home field advantage and potentially a first-round bye in the playoffs. Baltimore’s offense will need to take a step forward in 2020 as they struggled in the playoffs against a good Titans defense, scoring just 12 points.

So, Buffalo is still listed below the Patriots in Vegas odds as New England, despite losing Tom Brady , is still considered the favorite to win the AFC East and have the third best odds to win the conference. I am not buying into that. We saw Buffalo make major strides last year while quarterback Josh Allen still struggled with his efficiency. The Bills defense was stout, and they added to that defense this offseason. The Bills also went ahead and added Stefon Diggs to give Josh Allen yet another receiving weapon. Buffalo fell short in their playoff game against Houston last season but if Josh Allen can refine his passing ability at all this offense has the ability to make some noise while the Buffalo defense shuts down opponents.

Last year’s Cinderella story, Tennessee made it to the AFC championship game in 2019 and held an early lead of the Chiefs before Patrick Mahomes went to another level and the Titans defense just could not stop them in the second half. That said, to see the Titans at +1600 is quite surprising. The Titans are returning the majority of their team from last year while adding some solid players such as Vic Beasley to the team’s defense. The offense will again be built around game management by Ryan Tannehill and the downhill running of Derrick Henry who carried the Titans offense throughout the second half of the season and their playoff run. Head coach Mike Vrable will now be in year-three of implementing his system and it is quite surprising to see these odds here on Tennessee.

The 49ers won the NFC championship last season, going 13-3 and on the back of a shutdown defense and a dominant running attack. Their efforts fell short in the Super Bowl against the Chiefs, but it should be no real shock to see them considered a favorite to win the NFC championship once again. The Niners are returning most of their roster for last season with the exception of mid-season acquisition Emmanuel Sanders who left in free agency. Schedule wise the 49ers will be playing the AFC and NFC East divisions which can be considered rather soft when considering the opponents, they will draw such as the Redskins, Jets, Dolphins and Giants whom all project to be sub-.500 teams. A favorable schedule will put them in a good spot at one of the league’s top records and a shot at home field advantage. At +500 you are getting great odds on a team that was just in the Super Bowl last season.

Like the 49ers, the Saints also sit at +500 odds to win the NFC and they too finished last year with a 13-3 record. With Drew Brees returning and the signing of Emmanuel Sanders in the offseason there is much more buzz surrounding the Saints than the 49ers as true favorites to finish atop of the NFC. The Saints offensive attack as been more focused around the run-in recent seasons in an effort to keep Brees healthy and good to go come playoff time. Unfortunately, the playoffs have not been too friendly in recent seasons, having been eliminated by the Vikings in the Wild Card round in 2019. With the Saints being perennial front runners in the NFC and Brees on the final legs of his career we could certainly see the Saints gearing up for a big 2020.

You acquire Tom Brady and Rob Gronkowski and all of a sudden, the outlook on your season changes drastically. The Buc’s are the public darling right now with the idea of Brady going to Tampa and making them contenders. Last season Tampa finished with a 7-9 record but found themselves playing in plenty of close games. Last season’s quarterback Jameis Winston threw 30 interceptions compared to Brady who threw just eight. Now, sure, 2019 was far from Brady’s best season but the offense the Patriots surrounded him with was abysmal. With the likes of Gronkowski, Mike Evans and Chris Godwin now catching footballs the belief is we get a rejuvenated Brady who is just a few years removed from an MVP season.

Putting my cards on the table here, I like the Seahawks as my longshot play. I think they have a real shot to win the NFC West and might have been bigger players in the 2019 playoffs if not for the rash of injuries that forced them to bring Marshawn Lynch out of retirement to give them some assemblance of a running game which even then was non-existent. Russell Wilson is a winner, that type of intangible cannot be measured but he often carries Seattle and keeps them in games that they may not be in with another quarterback. The continued development of DK Metcalf as a legit receiving threat will be a boost to the offense which also saw breakout seasons from Tyler Lockett and running back Chris Carson last year. Should Seattle draft some impact players on the offensive line or defense then I would not be shocked to see them playing for the chance to go to the Super Bowl.

The Packers leaned heavily on the running game in 2019 with Aaron Jones exploding for 1,084 yards and 16 touchdowns while adding 49 catches for 474 yards and three more scores. The team finished 13-3 but never quite looked that dominant with the lack of a passing attack due to injuries at the wide receiver position. That said, Aaron Rodgers did all that he could with the players he was given and finished with 26 touchdowns and just four interceptions while throwing for 4,002 yards. The Packers defense was better than expected early on but eventually was exposed against better competition. That said, with better health from Davante Adams and the likelihood that the Packers draft a wide receiver in this upcoming receiver rich NFL Draft it’s hard to count out the Packers at those appealing +1200 odds.

I never count out teams with an elite defense and that is what the Bears bring to the table when considering them as potential NFC champions. We also saw how successful a team with a strong running game and a quarterback that can manage game behind an elite defense with the 49ers making it to the Super Bowl and in the AFC, though not an elite defense still a good defense, the Titans making it to the AFC championship. The Bears acquired Nick Foles from the Jaguars this offseason who has playoff experience and won a Super Bowl with the Eagles two seasons ago. Foles will “compete” with Mitch Trubisky for the starting gig but all things considered this should be Foles job to lose. If the Bears offense can show any level of competency under Foles then it should score enough points to win games while the defense shuts down the opposition.

Repeating as Super Bowl champion is no easy feat but the Chiefs are a team built for the long haul with elite young talent lead by quarterback Patrick Mahomes and a coach who always has his team in the thick of it in Andy Reid. Last season the Chiefs dealt with adversity with both Patrick Mahomes and Tyreek Hill missing time and playing at less than 100-percent but once the playoffs hit the Chiefs were ready dance and they finished the year on the top of the mountain following their Super Bowl victory over the 49ers. Of any team in the AFC I think they will be the most consistent and therefore you would be getting a great return on at +650 if they do in fact go back-to-back.

So, Vegas thinks the Super Bowl champion is coming from the AFC with the Chiefs and Ravens pulling in with the top odds. Baltimore took off last season behind MVP quarterback Lamar Jackson and a strong defense but ultimately were upset in the playoffs by Tennessee. This isn’t my favorite pick, there should still be some skepticism regarding Lamar Jackson and his ability to repeat his 2019 season which saw him lead the league in touchdown passes while also setting an NFL quarterback record by rushing for 1,206 yards. The longevity and sustained success for mobile quarterbacks in the NFL has been fleeting over the years and Jackson will need to show that his improved pass accuracy is the real deal.

The 49ers rode their elite defense and rushing attack to an NFC Championship and Super Bowl appearance in 2019. They had developments from rookie wide receiver Deebo Samuel towards the second half of the season which should also be encouraging. That said, quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo certainly seemed exposed during the team’s playoff run and that has me questioning whether a true repeat season is in order and thus makes the 49ers a risky bet to make.

Yup, the Gronk trade has moved the Buccaneers into a tie for the third best odds to win the Super Bowl. Interestingly enough Tampa is still not the odds favorite to win their own division, but Vegas is clearly thinking that if Tampa makes it to the dance that Tom Brady is going to get the job done. Even if Gronk isn’t 100% the player he was in New England following his one-year retirement, if Tampa gets 80-percent of that then he will be among the top tight ends in football and gives Brady a comfortable receiver to target while also working with Mike Evans and Chris Godwin .

The Saints are still favored to win the NFC South and have the same odds as the Buccaneers to win the NFC championship, yet you are getting them at +1400. New Orleans added Emmanuel Sanders to their offense this offseason and Drew Brees is coming back from another run before he retires. The Brees vs Brady back and forth is going to be a storyline all season as they compete against one another. This is again, not a bad return here either and I like the Saints more than the 49ers here as well.

The Titans are my longshot pick here at +4000. Sure, they went on an incredible run behind Derrick Henry and quarterback Ryan Tannehill who played out of his mind, but this team has the makeup to be a contender under Mike Vrable. Add to it that the division is certainly up for grabs and the fact that they made it to the AFC championship game last season. This team is going to use the game management of Tannehill while still running with Henry while playing a strong defense. I expect the Titans to go defense in the draft as well to really add some depth in the secondary where they were surprisingly a bit weak last season with the down year from Malcolm Butler ."

In particular, President Trump reckons Gov. Brian Kemp of Georgia - a fellow Republican - ‘had gone too far' and ‘too fast' when it comes to reopening businesses in the state that has accumulated a total of 21,102 COVID-19 cases and 846 deaths till date, as of time of writing, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The president specifically said ‘safety has to predominate' and that people could wait a little longer before businesses start reopening. Oklahoma's governor has also revealed plans to let certain businesses reopen soon.

President Trump certainly isn't alone in making sure his opinion is heard loud and clear. Public health experts and mayors alike are against the idea, too, for fear that the reopening of businesses so soon could potentially lead to more COVID-19 infections and deaths. At time of writing, the total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the United States stands at a whopping 842,625 while the death toll has reached 46,785.

The battle to contain the coronavirus in the United States is far from over. Majority of state governors have imposed as well as extended stay-at-home orders in order to keep their people safe, although the move to stem the spread of the coronavirus and prevent more deaths comes at great economic loss.

Safe distancing measures are still highly encouraged and governors across the country are advised to gradually reopen their state for business only if data shows that the state has had the 14-day decline in coronavirus cases according to White House guidelines."

• Allows anyone with an active unemployment claim to receive up to 26 weeks of benefits
• Suspends the requirement for an individual seeking unemployment to request a registration and work search waiver from their employer
• Allows Unemployment Insurance Agency retirees to keep their retirement benefits if they return to work to process unemployment claims or serve on the Occupational Health and Safety Commission

The Michigan Unemployment Agency said Thursday that it has provided an estimated 820,000 unemployed Michigan workers $1.37 billion in benefits.

Watch Ramos use the truncated Fauci clip as fuel with which to burn down an army of straw men, followed by what Fauci actually said (Click ""Expand"" to view full transcript):

RAMOS: How is it possible- it’s an honest question. How is it possible that the world’s most powerful country- that the world’s wealthiest country- Maria Antonieta- have those numbers, when we’ve known, since January 21st, which is when the first case was reported here in the United States. And President Trump waited until March 13th before making a decision. So...why was something not done sooner? How are we accepting these terrible numbers like this? Anthony Fauci, who is, of course the advisor- one of President Donald Trump’s main advisors- who, by the way, has advised six American presidents- RAMOS: He had an interview with CNN. And he told it exactly like it is. If they’d acted sooner- Had the Trump Administration acted sooner, more lives would have been saved. And we have what he said, so that you don’t (have to) take my word for it. Listen to him instead. DR. ANTHONY FAUCI: ...and you started mitigation earlier, you could’ve saved lives. Obviously, no one is gonna deny that. RAMOS: It’s as simple as that. Had we begun the measures sooner, lives would have been saved. I’ll say it again because it’s very important. Had we acted sooner, more lives would have been saved. And since we didn’t act sooner, since we had all the information beforehand, since the government had all the information beforehand and took no action, Anthony Fauci is saying that this is why we have so many deaths. FAUCI: You know, it isn't as simple as that, Jake, I'm sorry. I mean, to just say this is all happening because we got started too late. Obviously, if you looked could you have done something a little bit earlier it would have had an impact, obviously. But where we are right now is the result of a number of factors. The size of the country, the heterogeneity of the country. It’s- I think it’s a little bit unfair to compare us to South Korea where they had an outbreak in Daegu and they had the capability of immediately, essentially shutting it off completely in a way that we may not have been able to do in this country. So obviously, it would have been nice if we had a better head start. But I don’t think you could say that we are where we are because of one factor. It’s very complicated, Jake.

Naturally, Univision’s viewers didn’t get to hear the rest of Fauci’s statements because they would’ve immediately blown Ramos’ rant out of the water.

It should be noted that Ramos’ on-air editorial was a companion to his opinion column, the only such column among anchors of a prime-time network newscast in the United States, subty titled “Trump’s Failure”. Ramos’ columns are relevant to this discussion because in his on-air editorial he attempted to establish the period between January 21st and March 13th as a timeline of inaction. But what was Ramos discussing in his opinion columns during that same time period where ""something was not done sooner""?

Going back to January 27th, and in order:
• Biden’s criticism of Obama deportations (extracted during interview with Ramos)

It turns out that, with the exception of his column on the Diamond Princess, coronavirus wasn’t top-of-mind for Ramos either. When compared with his opinion columns during that same time period, it becomes clear that Ramos’ rant was little less than performative outrage and disinformation in furtherance of an agenda, to wit: to express opposition to the Trump Administration and to drive fear within the Hispanic population.

Univision’s viewers deserve better, and the marketplace cries out for an alternative."
182,182,https://www.fnarena.com/index.php/2020/04/23/research-real-energy-expanding-across-the-east/,"RESEARCH: Real Energy, Expanding Across The East",,www.fnarena.com,"Pitt Street Research has identified two sources for potential upside to the investment case for Real Energy

As mentioned in our initiation report, Real Energy ((RLE)) is expanding its operations across the Australian East Coast to address the highly lucrative market opportunity.

In addition to its legacy acreage – the Windorah Gas Project in the Cooper Basin – RLE was also awarded a tenement in the Surat Basin in October 2019. Recently, an independent study revealed substantial prospective resource play of 694PJ in this permit area.

In our view, this presents a further upside potential to RLE if it is able to convert substantial resources to reserves at the acreage.

Ever since it received the licence for pipeline construction, the Windorah Gas Project has been attracting potential partners to the tenement. Currently, RLE is in talks with two prospective funding partners, both of which are presently conducting due diligence.

We believe that this funding will substantially de-risk the project by supporting the development of the acreage. If RLE is able to secure the funding, it can accelerate the development of the gas pipeline to Mt. Howitt.

In addition, RLE can undertake horizontal fracking, which could substantially boost the production potential.

We reiterate our valuation for RLE at $0.15 per share base case and at $0.25 optimistic case using a DCF approach for the Windorah Gas Project.

We have retained our basic assumptions from the time of initiation. For conservatism’s sake, we have not included Project Venus in our estimations.

However, given the promising nature of the tenements adjacent to Project Venus, we believe it presents a potential source for further re-rating of RLE in the medium term.

183,183,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/barricades-labrador-west-covid-19-1.5542124,Barricades and checkpoints going up in Labrador to halt non-essential travel | News,"Wabush Mayor Ron Barron has had it with people coming into his community without a good reason during the COVID-19 pandemic, while Happy Valley-Goose Bay town council has voted to put up checkpoint of its own.",www.cbc.ca,"Wabush Mayor Ron Barron has had it with people coming into his western Labrador community without a good reason during the COVID-19 pandemic.

So he and others are putting an end to it, even though Barron is not sure that his plan is actually legal, and a provincial government department is sure it is not.

In central Labrador, Happy Valley-Goose Bay decided Thursday to put in checkpoints of its own, an indication that communities in Labrador are trying to put a lid on transmission of the highly infectious disease.

Starting Thursday, Wabush and Labrador City will not be allowing any travellers into the region without a letter stating they are an essential worker or have an urgent need.

""We're not going to try to deny anybody who needs essentials, like, I use the example of formula or diapers for a baby,"" Barron said.

""But the person who is coming here to look for green onions for their stir-fry? They don't need to be here.""

However, in a later interview with CBC News, Labrador City mayor Fabian Benoit said municipal staff will not be physically stopping travellers.

""We're not going to physically get in front of anybody's vehicle and tell them they have no right to come in and to turn around and go home,"" he said.

""We don't have that authority, and that's been made quite clear to us by not only the provincial government but the federal government as well.""

Benoit said the checkpoints are about continuing to educate the public on the importance of travelling only for essential reasons. Barron agreed with his neighbouring mayor.

Despite the fact Wabush is about a four-hour drive from Churchill Falls and almost nine hours from Happy Valley-Goose Bay, Barron said they are still seeing people make the drive for things like shopping at Walmart.

Barron said the councils in Labrador West are working with Fermont, Que., to make sure if people need something they can't get in their town, they can get it without putting anyone at risk in neighbouring towns.

Wabush has had checkpoints at the town's entrances for about two weeks now, but staff was using them to hand out information on COVID-19 to people passing by. The checkpoints were staffed eight hours a day.

Barron said motorists have been waiting for the checkpoints to close before driving into town.

Now the checkpoints will be staffed 24 hours a day.

The move comes at a time when Newfoundland and Labrador has gone six straight days without any new cases of COVID-19. There have been none in Labrador West, but Barron said he's not taking chances on an outbreak happening now.

He's been frustrated since the pandemic began at what he considers to be mixed messages from the provincial government. People were told to avoid non-essential travel, but going from one community to another has not been a ticketable offence.

In Labrador, where towns are small and remote, community leaders wanted to see bans put in place on intraprovincial travel.

""If you want to go take your camper and go camping, you're not even allowed to do that now. The RNC will enforce that measure. But yet, Ron Barron tomorrow could jump in his car and drive to Goose Bay and go shopping at the NorthMart over there. And no one is enforcing that,"" he said.

""It's crazy and ludicrous that measure has not been put in place not just in Labrador and Labrador West, but across the entire province.""

Meanwhile, Happy Valley-Goose Bay's town council voted to put up a checkpoint of their own, with a 6-1 vote at Thursday afternoon's meeting.

The ""Roadside Information and Public Awareness"" checkpoint will starting Friday, with town staff handing out information near the weigh scales on the Trans-Labrador Highway and at the main gate to 5 Wing Goose Bay. The checkpoints will operate from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. AT.

""We're trying to do the right thing to stop COVID-19 from coming to, not just Lake Melville area, but to all communities of Labrador,"" said Happy Valley-Goose Bay Mayor Wally Andersen.

But the mayor said it remains to be seen if staff can legally block people from entering the community.

""It'd be very hard to do,"" he said.

Coun. Michelle Baikie, who voted against the checkpoint, raised concerns about the safety of town staff.

""What if somebody gets out of the car and gets upset with the town employee?"" said Baikie, who is also concerned about staff maintaining physical distance from people.

Andersen, however, said the town has enough personal protective equipment for staff, and that physical distancing will be maintained.

The mayor said he is worried about Labrador's ability to respond to an outbreak of COVID-19, since there are no ICU beds available in the region.

""Furthermore, if someone on the North Coast gets stricken with this virus, and they need an ICU bed and they've got to be medevaced —imagine that torture on the family,"" said Andersen.

""This can strike hundreds and hundreds of people. And we're all well aware of the epidemics that happened in the past that wiped out communities in Labrador … so we're very, very concerned,"" he said.

Not sure if barricades are legal

Labrador municipal leaders had a conference call on the weekend with Premier Dwight Ball. Barron said he told the premier he was going ahead with barricades, and he said Ball told him to go for it.

""So what we're seeing are a number of communities working very hard and very diligent to make sure that we reduce the amount of nonessential travel,"" he said, adding it's important to know who's coming in and out of communities.

But when it comes to blocking people from entering towns, Ball wasn't clear if the practice is legal.

""I guess that will be dependent on who tests the law,"" said Ball.

The Department of Municipal Affairs said Thursday afternoon that Minster Derrick Bragg told Labrador mayors on Wednesday that they do not have authority to stop people from entering their towns.

In a statement, the department said towns can set up booths to provide information about COVID-19 to people entering communities. They have also advised municipalities not to issue their own states of emergency.

Richard Pusey, 41, was hit with a string of charges late on Thursday night after he was allegedly clocked at 140km/h on Melbourne's Eastern Freeway at Kew on Wednesday before testing positive to drugs.

A group of police officers, which included a new recruit and a mother-of-two, were mowed down by a truck as they stood on the roadside waiting for his sports car to be impounded.

Late on Thursday night, Homicide Squad detectives charged Pusey with multiple offences including reckless conduct endangering life, failing to remain after a drug test and drug possession.

Before fleeing the scene, Pusey is alleged to have taken several distressing images of their bodies strewn across the road - posting them on his Facebook page, instead of helping to save their lives.

The reason Pusey wasn't hurt was because he had been urinating at the side of the road at the time of the crash.

In the photos - which Daily Mail Australia has seen but are too graphic to publish - an officer's body is shown on the roof of the black Porsche.

The truck ploughed into the officer with such force one of them was thrown into the air.

Another officer is seen laid on the road, surrounded by blood, next to the truck.

Other drivers and witnesses are seen trying to help the fallen officers.

After allegedly taking the gruesome pictures, Pusey is alleged to have fled the scene on foot, but was arrested less than 24 hours later.

Leading Senior Constable Lynette Taylor, Constable Glen Humphris, Senior Constable Kevin King, and Constable Josh Prestney were all killed.

On Thursday night, Victoria Police's chief commissioner, Graham Ashton, called the alleged posting of the pictures online 'disgusting'.

'It's incredible, I've never encountered anything like it,' he told The Project.

'And the more you hear about that sort of behaviour, you're just disgusted by it.

'We'll be making sure that when we present this person to court, ultimately, we'll be making sure the court knows all about that behaviour that we believe took place at the scene.

'Normally, you should be doing what any sensible person would do and that is to render assistance.

'To just leave the scene and not render any assistance, it's appalling behaviour in our view.'

Failing to render assistance when people have died carries a maximum prison sentence of 10 years.

Late on Thursday, Pusey was charged with driving dangerously at speed, reckless conduct endangering life, failing to remain after a drug test, failing to render assistance, fail to exchange detail, possessing a drug of dependence, destruction of evidence and three counts of commit indictable offence while on bail.

He was remanded in custody to appear at Melbourne Magistrates' Court on Friday.

Police are urging anyone who was driving in the area who has dashcam footage, in particular the movements of the truck immediately before the collision, to come forward.

After leaving the scene, Pusey allegedly showed the pictures to staff at a Chemist Warehouse in Collingwood on Thursday morning, who then called police.

Pusey was then arrested in store, with police later seen searching his home.

He has since described as a 'playboy' by one Melbourne mortgage broker.

The man told the Herald Sun Pusey enjoyed showing off his Porsche and multi-million dollar home.

Mohinder Singh Bajwa, the driver of the truck - who had a 'medical episode' and blacked out at the scene - remains under police guard in hospital.

It comes amid reports Pusey only avoided being killed in the horror crash because he was urinating by the side of the road at the time of impact.

A Highway Patrol car pulled him over at around 4.50pm and carried out a drug test.

It is alleged he tested positive, so two more officers were called to help in impounding his Porsche.

Within minutes of the second police car arriving, Mr Bajwa's refrigerated truck struck the three cars - and the four officers standing on the roadside.

Commissioner Ashton said he had already met with the victims' devastated families.

'I did have that opportunity, yes,' he said.

'I went today to visit of all the immediate families of the officers who we lost last night and were tragically killed in this collision.

'They're obviously shocked, and attempting to come to terms with everything that they've experienced in the last 24 hours.

'What was left impressed upon me is what great families they were.'

He confirmed the incident began as a simple speeding check, with officers alleging the Porsche had been travelling at around 140km/h.

Commissioner Ashton police have still not had the opportunity to interview the truck's driver, saying he 'wasn't ruling anything out'.

'Initially, he had a medical episode at the scene,' he explained.

'He blacked out at the scene, and then was treated by ambulance officers at the scene.

'They felt that his condition was such that he needed to go to hospital under police guard, and that's still the case, he's been admitted to hospital.'

Commissioner Ashton released obituaries of the four officers on Thursday evening as the police community mourned its loss.

Several devastated relatives also took to Facebook on Wednesday night to post heartbreaking tributes to their loved ones.

Constable Prestney, 28, only graduated from the academy in November when he was killed, having joined the force in May 2019.

'Josh was a much loved and respected member of his squad,' his obituary read.

'His brother, First Constable Alexander Prestney, is also a police officer and presented Josh with his badge when he graduated in December last year.'

'In his spare time Josh enjoyed keeping fit and trained for and competed in triathlons. He is survived by his parents Andrew and Belinda, and his brother, First Constable Alex Prestney.'

Constable Prestney completed a Bachelor in creative industries at the Australian College of the Arts before joining and was stationed at Boroondara.

Senior Constable Taylor, 60, had a distinguished 31-year career with Victoria Police, joining in January 1989 and graduating in May of that year.

She was recognised by the Chief Commissioner for good work while performing duties at the traffic camera office.

She also earned the National Medal first clasp, National Police Service medal and the Victoria Police Service medal fourth clasp.

Senior Constable Taylor is survived by her husband, a former Victoria Police officer, Stuart Schultz and their two sons, Nathan and Alexander.

'Having travelled the world, Lynette is remembered for having a great sense of adventure and has instilled this spirit in her children,' her obituary read.

'Lynette was the primary carer for her sister who had recently suffered a stroke, and this reflected her caring nature, which extended to those she worked with.

'Lynette had a reputation of going into bat for others and challenging decisions that she believed were unfair.

'She had a great sense of humour and her colleagues will fondly remember seeing her smiling face every day.'

Constable Glen Humphris also only started his police career last year and graduated in March.

Born in Gosford, on the NSW Central Coast, he left school and became an apprentice carpenter and then a personal trainer.

While working for Return to Work in Newcastle he met his partner of four years, Todd, and they moved to Melbourne last year.

'His squad mates said he genuinely wanted to help people, had a great sense of community and genuine empathy for everyone – victim and offender alike,' his obituary read.

'Glen is remembered as being very level-headed, caring and supportive with a great sense of humour and had the ability to make light of any situation to calm people.'

Senior Constable King was with Victoria Police for six years, working at several stations in and around Melbourne before joining the Nunawading Highway patrol in April 2019.

'Kevin was passionate about road policing and knew that it was not just about giving out tickets,' his obituary read.

He transferred to the Nunawading Highway Patrol in 2018 where the officer in charge described him as 'an older head with a lot of life experience who always made good judgement calls and decisions'.

Senior Constable King is survived by his wife Sharron Mackenzie, and their three children, William, James and Henry.

Fallen in the line of duty: Emotional tributes flow for the victims of horrific Melbourne crash The first victim of the horrific crash which cost four Victorian police officers their lives has been identified as 28-year-old Josh Prestney. Mr Prestney had only graduated from the academy last November, and was working a short stint with the road policing unit before he was to be transferred to Kew police station. His grandmother Eliza Anderson told the Herald Sun Mr Prestney was 'so proud to serve' his community. He had reportedly only started in his new role on Tuesday, the day before the accident. 'We were so proud of you. God bless Josh. Miss you forever,' she wrote on Facebook. Leading Senior Constable Lynette Taylor, Constable Glen Humphris and Senior Constable Kevin King were all also tragically killed on Wednesday night. Chief Commissioner Graham Ashton paid an emotional tribute to the fallen officers on Thursday. 'Their names will forever be remembered, their service honoured, and their memories celebrated,' he said. 'These officers were undertaking their everyday duties in helping to keep the community safe when they were killed. 'They were members of our Road Policing Drug and Alcohol Section and Highway Patrol. They were our colleagues, our friends, our squad mates, our family. 'Each from different backgrounds, each with different life experiences, each with a common goal to keep the community safe. 'Their families will never be the same and our thoughts and prayers are with them. 'We continue to investigate this incident to ensure that we uncover every detail that led to this tragic outcome. We will do this for those we have lost and for their families. 'Committing one’s life to serving and protecting others is a truly unique attribute. It takes a special person to put on the blue uniform and turn up to work each day to respond to those in need. 'They do it to protect. They do it to make a difference. 'As many will attest, the everyday nature of police work can sometimes seem mundane, but this week’s events are a timely reminder of how quickly that can change. 'No one goes to work expecting not to return home to their loved ones at the end of their shift. 'I want to acknowledge every man and woman that has in the past and continues to serve for Victoria Police. Your contributions are recognised and respected at every level, and you should know this. 'To the serving police officers and PSOs currently on our frontline and the staff who provide support to them, I want to extend my sincere gratitude for your ongoing support and commitment to your duty. 'It is more important now than ever, that we look after one another and speak up if we need help or someone to talk to. 'Time and time again, I am overwhelmed by how our people rally together during the tough and challenging times – through natural disasters, state-wide emergencies, mass tragedies and the loss of our own. 'They go where they are needed, without question and without hesitation. 'We stand side by side in our daily response to the Victorian community. And today we stand side by side as we reflect and grieve. 'The outpouring of community support to date has been truly remarkable and touching and on behalf of Victoria Police, I thank you for this. 'It will take time for many to recover from this tragedy, but we should take comfort in knowing that we stand together as a police family and as a Victorian community.'"

The initiative was part of the company’s contribution to mitigate the impact of the COVID – 19 pandemic on homes.

At a handover ceremony of the food items in Lagos, the Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of Lekki Gardens Estate, Mr. Richard Nyong stated that the food materials were for over 1000 families in communities where their estates are located. These, he listed to include Awoyaya, Parapo, Lakowe, Olokunla, Alabeko, Owode, and Ikate-Elegushi, all in Lagos State.

At an average of four persons per household, he noted the company was actually supporting and touching the lives of over 4000 persons across the seven communities in the intervention, emphasising that whatever it would cost the company, within its means, to touch lives at this period, it would do.

According to Richard Nyong, who was represented by the Chief Engagement Officer of Lekki Gardens Estate, Romeo Akinwade, given that the country, and indeed the world, was united in confronting the pandemic, “our organisation is also standing together with the Government to ensure that we leave no-one behind. Hence, we appreciate all who are partnering with us in this initiative to touch as many lives as possible: whether it be our staff, our host communities and our residents.”

He reiterated that the act of good neighborliness by the company was consistent with its primary business goal which was to live a fulfilled life – better living; more wealth; and a secure future.

However, he added: “We recognise that true wealth lies not in the pocket but in the heart, which explains why we have consistently been part of our communities, being our neighbour’s keeper, since we began business close to a decade ago.”

The Lekki Gardens Estate Chief Executive further noted that today, many Nigerians are hungry, and hopeless, adding that there was a strong feeling of abandonment, and frustration, driving some into anti-social and criminal activities. These unusual times, he said, required, “that we give succor to the masses in our communities.”

Appealing to other people and organisations to step forward and assist, Nyong stated that the COVID-19 outbreak was predicted to have significant impact on various segments of the world, noting that the populations most at risk are those that depend heavily on the informal economy; have inadequate access to social services; and therefore have limited opportunities to cope.

“By coming together as a people to play our parts, especially as we continue to see increasing cases of the corona virus across the land, our positive actions will in no small measure help to stem the spread of this pandemic,” he added.

Nyong, also enjoined the benefitting families to take responsibility and remain safe. According to him, our collective responsibility to ourselves and to one another does not end with support from organisations.

“From the less than twenty of us gathered here today, we have come to accept that the pandemic has also affected the way we live. We therefore encourage all of us to continuously adhere to the safety precautions and restrictions put in place to curb the spread of the virus.”

“As we re-commit to our vision of being continually connected with our host communities, while striving to bridge the housing deficit gap in the country, we also urge you to stay safe. Please take responsibility: stay at home, regularly wash your hands with soap, observe social distancing, use a sanitiser, and a face mask. Assist your neighbours in every way possible. If we all play our parts, we can assist Government and socially responsible companies such as ours to stop the spread of COVID – 19.”"

Luxembourg, 23 April 2020 — SES announced today that the number of global TV households it reaches directly or indirectly via satellite has increased by 12 million to 367 million in 2019. Findings from the company’s annual Satellite Monitor market research validates, once again, SES’s position as the world’s leading video content distributor via satellite and shows the important role that satellite continues to play in reaching the largest possible audience globally.

Much of the increase in the 12 million TV households is attributed to the leading infrastructure of TV reception – satellite and cable – which grew by 9 million in 2019 to 153 million and 149 million homes respectively. Internet Protocol TV (IPTV) and terrestrial TV grew by a combined 3 million to 43 million and 21 million homes.

The Satellite Monitor study also showed that SES’s technical reach has increased across several continents, including Europe, Africa, Asia-Pacific (APAC), and Latin America (LATAM). Europe continues to be the strongest market for SES, with 168 million total households served by the SES fleet, up by 1 million from 2018, followed by North America at 69 million.

In LATAM, SES has captured an audience of 42 million households, a significant increase from the 34 million households reported in 2018, thanks in part to the launch of a new satellite – SES 14 – which is boosting cable and IPTV growth in the region. This year also marked the first year that SES collected results from Indonesia and the Philippines. In total, SES serves 39 million APAC households with Direct-to-Home (DTH) feeds. The research also found that SES delivers digital television to 13 million households in the Middle East and 35 million homes in Africa. Altogether, SES has observed a combined growth of almost 5 million households across APAC and Africa.

SES’s TV market research sheds light on several key trends behind the relevance of satellite broadcasting, including the transition from analog to digital TV and the rise of HD broadcast. End consumers in Ghana and Nigeria are choosing satellite TV for its better value proposition and free-to-air offerings, rather than purchasing new hardware and switching to digital terrestrial TV. The Satellite Monitor study also revealed that HD broadcast has been on the rise in Europe, with 167 million TV households, an increase of 5 million from 2018. Satellite remains the preferred choice of infrastructure when it comes to HD content broadcasting, underscoring the key value proposition of satellite broadcasting as a reliable and cost-effective video delivery to large audiences.

“Broadcasters and TV platform operators need robust and reliable data before they make the decision to enter new markets. For more than 25 years, SES has been the only satellite-based solutions provider in the world to regularly and extensively monitor the industry in specific countries and identify key trends for our customers to help them succeed in their business and expand their reach,” said Ferdinand Kayser, CEO at SES Video. “The results of our annual Satellite Monitor market research demonstrate that satellite continues to be the most optimal infrastructure to deliver high picture quality, and that despite changing consumption habits, people still strongly rely on linear TV and complement it with OTT content.”

Introduced in 1994, SES’s annual Satellite Monitor research reveals the detailed technical reach of SES and valuable insights into the video market and trends worldwide. It is seen as an important tool for SES’s customers, the leading broadcasters and content owners.

But although the mood is bound to be a bit sober given the current lockdown circumstances, there will be some much-needed musical entertainment, thanks to stars like Luke Bryan, Kelly Clarkson, Jennifer Hudson, One Republic, and HER making special appearances.

The 2020 NFL Draft event will commence on Thursday night as originally scheduled and will be conducted virtually, with potential players, NFL teams, and network analysts all participating from their homes. The draft was originally scheduled to take place in Las Vegas from April 23 onwards, but will now be held at locations around the country via satellite link feeds. The three-day event will begin on April 23, Thursday, at 8 pm ET (the most important day, when all the best players get picked in the first round) and the seven rounds of the draft will go on till 12 pm ET on Saturday, April 25.

'American Idol' alumni and Oscar-winner Jennifer Hudson will be performing on Thursday. The star posted a promotional picture for her performance on social media, saying ""Don’t miss it! Watch on @nflnetwork and @espn April 23rd.""

'American Idol' winner and 'The Voice' star Kelly Clarkson also revealed via social media that she will be performing her new single 'I Dare You' during the NFL Draft preshow on her birthday, April 24 at 6 pm ET. The new track features Clarkson and five other singers from all over the world who sing in different languages. ""It's basically I dare you to love instead of fear, instead of hate,"" Clarkson recently revealed on the Today show. ""Even though we're from all different parts of the world and different religions, politics, whatever, you know at the end of the day we’re all the same human race.""

'American Idol' judge and country music star Luke Bryan will be closing out the NFL event on Saturday, after performances by pop music icons One Republic and HER on April 25. Bryan will be performing his hit 'Play It Again' as part of Verizon's #PayItForwardLIVE series, which aims to support fans' local businesses by encouraging viewers to make online purchases.

""When I heard about the Pay It Forward program Verizon was doing to support local small businesses I loved the idea of doing my part to help raise awareness for it,"" Bryan revealed in a statement. ""These are the people who wake up every day living out their dreams and passions and bringing them into our communities. Let's all continue to do right, support each other and... Pay It Forward.""

Vehicles will line up in the parking lot of Prestige Kitchen on Read Drive in Summerside between",www.capebretonpost.com,"A parade involving emergency service vehicles will take place in East Prince on Friday to honour the victims of the recent shooting in Nova Scotia.

Vehicles will line up in the parking lot of Prestige Kitchen on Read Drive in Summerside between 11:30 and 11:45 a.m. before proceeding, with emergency lights flashing but no sirens, to the East Prince detachment of the RCMP in Bedeque where a ceremony will be held in memory of the lives lost.

Physical distancing measures will be in place for parade participants. The public is welcome to come out and show its support, either along the parade route or at the detachment but, for everyone's safety, people are being asked to stay six feet apart at all times.

Jason Woodbury, chief of the Miscouche Fire Department, said this tragedy hits too close to home for a number of reasons.

Woodbury is a native of Hants County, N.S., where some of the shootings occurred. He served as a volunteer firefighter at home more than 20 years ago, but he also knew RCMP Const. Heidi Stevenson, who died in the shootout. He had dealings with her a number of times over the phone as part of his role with CUPE Local 3324, the union that represents paramedics.

His last conversation with Stevenson was about four months ago.

“She was a genuine person,’’ Woodbury said, struggling at times with his emotions. “She actually had property (she talked about) on Prince Edward Island. She told me she had a cottage here and she was looking forward to coming over.

“For the dealings with her that I had, she was compassionate and she was genuine and honest.’’

Woodbury, who is helping to organize Friday’s parade, said he can’t describe his reaction when he turned on his television and saw that Stevenson was one of the victims.

“Speechless . . . it was overwhelming. That’s when I decided to shut the TV off and just do my own thing for a while.’’

Following are the emergency service agencies that have been invited to take part in Friday’s memorial parade:
• Every fire department from Lennox Island to Crapaud, police agencies, tow truck operators, corrections staff, sheriff’s department, conservation officers, Crime Stoppers, Canadian Coast Guard, P.E.I. Fire Marshal’s Office, Island EMS.

Woodbury said the parade will also honour veteran and retired firefighter Tom Bagley, another one of the victims in the shooting. Bagley would have turned 71 on Tuesday.

“As emergency services, we grieve just like normal people. We wear our uniforms, but that doesn’t protect us for grieving or showing support to other agencies that we work with on a regular basis.’’

Typically, emergency services personnel would have driven to Nova Scotia for the funerals, but that isn’t possible in the pandemic where physical distancing is a way of life, for now.

Woodbury said firefighters have a close relationship with the RCMP and municipal police forces. They respond to emergencies at all hours of the day and night.

“We have a very unique community; a unique family. This is our way to show our condolences and our support to the RCMP during a very difficult time in their family. They would do the same for us if we lost one of our members in the line of duty.’’

Once the parade arrives at the East Prince detachment of the RCMP, a wreath will be laid on behalf of all emergency services in the detachment’s coverage area (which extends east to Crapaud). Kensington Police Chief Lewie Sutherland will be laying flowers, and other police agencies are expected to do so.

There will also be a parade of emergency vehicles through Cornwall, Charlottetown and Stratford on Friday.

Vehicles will line up at the North River Fire Department at 11:45 a.m. The parade will proceed past the Maypoint detachment of the RCMP at noon and past RCMP L Division headquarters on University Avenue.

The parade will then wind its way through Charlottetown, ending at the new Cross Roads Fire Department where emergency service personnel will assemble for a photograph with the Nova Scotia flag.

Participating will be Island EMS, North River Fire Department, Charlottetown Police Services, provincial corrections, Cross Roads Fire Department, New Glasgow Fire Department, Cross Roads Fire Department and East River Fire Department.

192,192,https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/a-tale-of-two-comets-atlas-shrugs-borisov-is-finally-weird,"A tale of two comets: ATLAS shrugs, Borisov is finally weird","Comet Y4 ATLAS is disintegrating, and the interstellar comet Borisov has way too much carbon monoxide to be local.",www.syfy.com,"Last week I wrote about the first interstellar visitor to our solar system ever seen, called 'Oumuamua, and in that article I mentioned two comets: 2I/Borisov and C/2019 Y4 ATLAS. I have some updates about those comets.

First, Y4 ATLAS. Discovered in late 2019 in observations by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) in Hawaii, it promised to be a show-stopper. Although never getting closer than about 120 million kilometers from Earth, its position relative to us and the Sun and how rapidly it was brightening as it approached promised that by May 2020 it could be naked-eye visible and spectacular.

But then in early April, disaster: Astronomers reported it appeared to be breaking up, disintegrating. Comets do this sometimes; they are dust, gravel, and rocks held together by various ices, and as they approach the Sun that ice sublimates, turns directly to gas. While that is why they get so spectacular — the gas and dust leaving the comet can make a cloud thousands or tens of thousands of kilometers across, and when lit by the Sun can be quite bright — it can also mean a death sentence. If too much ice sublimates away the structural integrity of the comet gets compromised. It can calf (split into two big pieces) or it can fall apart.

Y4 ATLAS looks like it’s doing the latter. More observations have come in, and it's clear that there's a lot of debris around it; normally the tail near the head is smooth, but the lumps you can see in images are pieces of the comet that have fallen away from it.

A Hubble image taken just days ago on 20 April makes this case even more clearly:

This was taken by astronomer Ye Quanzhi, and was planned some time ago to determine the size of the comet's nucleus. He got more than he bargained for; now that the comet has fallen apart there are multiple nuclei, and it's hard to keep track of them:

There is still a bright nucleus there, so it's possible it will survive… but I have my doubts. It's still a bit farther from the Sun than Earth is, and still on approach to our star. In late May it will pass a mere 40 million kilometers from the Sun, well inside Mercury's orbit. If it's been disintegrating while still over 150 million km out, getting four times closer doesn't make me want to bet on it surviving the encounter*.

That's too bad; I was looking forward to seeing another bright comet. I've caught quite a few over the years and they're so wonderful to see! But alas, probably not this time.

The second comet is 2I Borisov, the second interstellar visitor ever seen. Over the past couple of months I've hammered how completely non-weird it is (especially compared to 'Oumuamua which is nothing but weird). It's been behaving exactly like a regular locally sourced comet in pretty much every way except for the fact that it's moving through the solar system so rapidly it must come from another star. It even calved recently, which is something our own comets do.

But finally, something odd has come up about it. Astronomers used the wonderful ALMA telescope array to look at the chemical makeup of the comet, and, as expected, they saw a lot of two different molecules: hydrogen cyanide (HCN) and carbon monoxide (CO), both of which are common in our own comets. The amount of HCN they saw was the same as in local comets, too.

But it's the CO where things get weird: Borisov has somewhere between 9 and 26 times the amount of carbon monoxide as solar system comets!

That's a big difference. Now, solar system comets vary in their CO content, but nothing like this has been seen from comets within about 300 million kilometers of the Sun. That's a lot of CO!

Carbon monoxide is a very common molecule in space. It's easy to form and has two very common atoms in it. It forms in very cold environments, roughly -250°C. Comets formed in the outer solar system back when the Sun and planets themselves were forming. It's very cold there, which is why we see CO in them.

But this much CO in Borisov indicates it must have formed under conditions different than found in our own system. We've seen disks of gas and dust around other stars where planets and comets form, and some of these disks are significantly bigger than the one where we formed. That means comets birthed around other stars could form in colder environments farther out, and get more CO in them. Or, it could mean it just formed around a cooler star than the Sun.

The problem here is we don’t really know, and we don’t have a lot of examples to look at. 'Oumuamua is just bizarre, and doesn't act much like a comet. Borisov does, but it's the only kinda sorta normal interstellar comet we've ever seen. Is this sort of CO content normal, or is Borisov an outlier? Do most systems form comets farther out than we did, or is our own recipe what's normally used by stars?

I suppose it's not unexpected that the first couple of galactic visitors we get raise more questions than answers. The obvious thing to do is find more of them. Given that we spotted two relatively close together in time, that implies we'll see lots more in the coming years, especially with bigger survey telescopes coming online. When that happens we’ll be able to start categorizing them, see how they are similar and/or different.

And once that happens comes the best part: Understanding them. The Universe is sending us samples of itself for free for us to study. I think it's wonderful we can accept such gifts.

*As usual when there's a bright comet, the conspiracy theorists get a jolt of adrenaline to their dumbosity. I've seen claims that Y4 ATLAS will hit Earth (it never gets closer to us than 120 million km!), or that it's a distraction from the government creating the COVID19 virus, or that the virus came from the comet, etc. These claims are really ridiculous, but I get a lot of email from people who don't know the science well enough to understand that, or from people who suffer from anxiety and are really concerned about this. Some of these conspiracy theorists are straight up con artists doing this for money or attention or giggles, and they are, in my opinion, flaming piles of human garbage."
193,193,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/comment/article-8251063/ALEX-BRUMMER-Britain-stares-financial-abyss-lockdown.html,ALEX BRUMMER: Britain stares into the financial abyss under lockdown,Damage done to Britain's prosperity by the severity of the lockdown is terrifying. It has not been made any easier by the wilful destruction of the country's smaller enterprises.,www.dailymail.co.uk,"Damage done to Britain's prosperity by the severity of the lockdown is terrifying.

It has not been made any easier by the wilful destruction of the country's smaller enterprises, which are the backbone of the economy, by the pathetically slow efforts of banks to get emergency loans out of the door and support output.

Just how quickly the UK has gone from stability to slump, from full employment to mass unemployment, is illustrated by the latest data.

This in turn is placing huge pressure on the public finances with the Institute for Fiscal Studies forecasting public borrowing of £260billion this year and the Government disclosing that it will have to issue £180billion of gilts to finance operations in 2020-21.

Weakness is evident from the latest purchasing managers' index, which looks to the future. It tumbled to just 12.9 in April.

Anything below 50 is regarded as recession territory so the numbers illustrate the scale of the Covid-19 depression. The UK number is half that of China at the peak of its pandemic and worse than the eurozone.

Among the reasons the UK has been hit so hard is that its prosperity is based on services – from hairdressing to the creative sector and consulting – many of which have been crushed by social distancing.

The great redeeming feature of the UK economy since the financial crisis, and during the Brexit interregnum, was the job creation miracle.

That is disappearing. Forecaster NIESR is warning that prospects for British workers are 'horrendous' and that it expects unemployment to rise by 5m to 6m by the end of May, lifting the jobless rate more than five times to 20 per cent of the workforce.

In the US job losses have climbed by a further 4.4m to 26m since the virus hit.

The only comfort to be drawn from the NIESR forecast is that it is partly the work of US-based British economist David Blanchflower, who was hopelessly wrong about job losses in Britain after the banking crisis.

Unless the business lockdown is rapidly lifted, he may be correct this time. Tragic.

Amid the dividend wasteland, Unilever has kept faith with investors.

It was not quite enough to shore up the share price amid flat results. Alan Jope, chief executive, has come up with the phrase 'new normal' to describe the headwinds as the Dove-to-Ben & Jerry's group adjusts to living with pandemics.

Unilever is not expecting the idealised 'V' shaped recovery. It will vary from country to country and Jope expects the 'South' – from Latin America to Africa – to be among the hardest hit parts of the world.

China offers some indications of the future. Personal grooming products have suffered, demands for hygiene surged and there has been a shift to digital in the supply chain. Unilever's less glamorous brand such as Domestos have come into their own.

Indeed, in an age of uncertainty Unilever is finding established, tried-and-tested brands are demanded.

Among the big hits in the first quarter was to ice cream. This is not surprising in an era of leisure closures, from Disneyland to the local Odeon. New normal in this category will be home deliveries of Magnum and Ben & Jerry's, especially in the USA.

There was market disappointment that Unilever hasn't enjoyed the coronavirus lift of P&G as yet. This reflects greater exposure in developing markets.

But as China, and latterly India, come back, so should sales. Unilever says it is focusing on keeping staff safe, protecting supply and seeking to give something back to society.

The medical emergency is showing the value of enterprises which work to stay on the ethical, social and green track.

THIN times for mergers and acquisitions. Just Eat, a winner from lockdown, has been cleared to be bought by Dutch-based Takeaway for £6.2billion – unless someone changes their mind.

That is precisely what is happening to Moss Bros, which, having agreed to be bought by Crew Clothing owner Menoshi Shina, finds the buyer seeking to wriggle out of the agreement.

Crew is invoking the 'material adverse change' (MAC) rule. A similar approach is being taken by Sycamore Partners in the US, which no longer appreciates the allure of Victoria's Secret.

With Moss Bros closed down and the wedding hire business moribund, Crew thinks it has a great case.

Precedent suggests it is pushing its luck."

Get all the openings, closings, and the business stories that are shaping Charleston and South Carolina here.

The one to watch

The Paycheck Protection Program — an emergency loan option billed as a lifeline for America's small businesses — is expected to be replenished with billions more in available dollars soon. The initial $349 billion allocated for the program dried out in just a couple weeks, leaving many behind.

The PPP offers businesses loans that are extremely advantageous to borrowers. The financing can be completely forgiven as long as the money is correctly used to cover payroll and expenses like rent and utilities.

How did South Carolina do in the first round of PPP funding? According to the most recent report from the U.S. Small Business Administration the state received more than $3.8 billion in PPP funding, distributed between almost 23,000 loans for an average of about $166,000 per loan.

Those figures reflect a report of loan approvals made through April 16 totaling $342.3 billion among all states, or about 98 percent of the money allocated by Congress for the program.

The financial advice platform Motley Fool used the state-level SBA data and factored in which areas were experiencing the highest unemployment claims to rank which states fared the best.

An index was found using the percentage of PPP funds awarded to a state's businesses compared to the state's percentage of unemployment claims. An index of 1.00 indicated the ratio of PPP dollars and unemployment claims were the same. An index below that meant a state bore a proportionally higher brunt of unemployment claims when compared to its share of PPP funding.

Using unemployment claims filed in the four weeks ending April 11, South Carolina's index was 0.82, ranking it tenth among the states that did the worst. Nevada had the lowest index at 0.39, followed by Michigan with 0.59. South Dakota, Wyoming and North Dakota topped the list of states that received proportionally more.

Bloomberg did its own analysis this week, too, using the same SBA state-by-state loan data and displaying it as a percentage of eligible payroll. In South Carolina, that factored out to be about 54 percent, placing the state in the bottom quarter of the pack.

California and New York had the lowest percentages by that analysis, about 38 percent and 40 percent, respectively. Nebraska had the highest, about 81 percent followed closely by the Dakotas and Kansas.

South Carolina's neighbors were in a similar position. About 52 percent of eligible payrolls were covered in North Carolina, and Georgia did slightly better with 57 percent of eligible payrolls covered.

The PPP loans were intended for businesses with 500 or fewer employees, but there are exceptions. For example, individual restaurants and hotels were allowed to be counted as if they were separate companies, even if they are controlled by the same owner.

That's what allowed a massive chain like Shake Shack to get in on the program, drawing ire from many of the small businesses left behind. (Shake Shack has since apologized and is giving the money back.)

Another large beneficiary was the Ruth's Chris Steakhouse chain which announced March 30 that it was permanently closing its downtown Charleston location. The company went on to receive $20 million in SBA loans.

Condor Hospitality Trust, a Maryland-based hotel company that the Orlando Sentinel recently reported applied for more than one loan, owns 15 lodgings, including a Home2 Suites in Summerville.

Carrols Restaurant Group, which owns more than 1,000 Burger King restaurants in 23 states including South Carolina, told investors on Friday that it might get aid from the program.

This week, the second infusion of aid for small businesses is making its way through Congress. The Senate passed a $484 billion deal Tuesday to replenish the tapped-out small business loan program. The bill includes:
• $310 billion more for the PPP with $60 billion of the funds set aside for medium, small and community lenders

The House still needs to approve the legislation.

“By no means is Santee Cooper done. There remains a lot of energy still behind wanting to sell Santee Cooper.”​

During a quarterly earnings call on Wednesday, Robo was asked about his company's multi-billion dollar offer to take over South Carolina's state-owned utility. The offer has been met with some resistance from state lawmakers, and the coronavirus pandemic has further complicated a possible deal.

Still, Andrew Brown writes, Robo was ""not prepared to admit defeat — at least not publicly."" Read more about Robo's comments.

""Hey boss, did you know eight out of ten Americans have concerns about returning to dine-in restaurants?""

According to new surveys conducted by the food research firm Datassential, the majority of diners support a number of safety precautions that could mitigate risk when restaurants are allowed to reopen for dine-in service.

Reducing seating capacity, keeping diners six feet apart, requiring guests to sanitize their hands before they enter a restaurant and not allowing patrons to stand at the bar were all OK'd by most survey respondents.

So far, Georgia is the only state that's established a reopening date for dine-in restaurants (it's April 27, next Monday), and some leading restaurateurs in the Peach State have already said that they don't plan to welcome diners back yet, citing the potential financial and safety costs.

Georgia restaurant owners told food editor Hanna Raskin that they were blindsided by the governor's announcement. Steven Satterfield, chef and co-owner of Atlanta’s Miller Union called the decision ""irresponsible.""

""A lot of us are feeling very angry right now,” Satterfield said. Read more about the industry's response in Raskin's recent coverage.

Spanning more than 16,000 square feet, the aptly named hotel and restaurant will float above Austria’s Thalersee lake—not far from the city of Graz.

The proposal would remove a dilapidated existing structure and the artificial coastline. Through unique staging and location, Land Ahoy would renaturalize the shoreline and eliminate the unnatural flood control barrier created by previous developments. A spacious footbridge will merge with a circular ramp to lead swimmers—and skaters during winter—to a courtyard framed by the new building. A hiking trail will also be created to provide access to visitors arriving on land.

“Entering the rotunda in the lake via this underwater tunnel will be an incomparable experience,” says Philipp Buxbaum of Smartvoll. “Once you reach the end of the underwater pathway, you will emerge out of the lake—fully surrounded by water, creating an immersive and unforgettable impression. “Since recreation is the ying to our working yang, we strongly believe that buildings dealing with recreation should go well beyond providing food and a place to sleep.”"

Dallas-based Southwest had about 2.8 million scheduled seats on flights last week, 25% fewer than it did in January, according to airline tracking company OAG. But it was still more than American's 2 million seats and nearly three times as much as Delta and United.

Both Delta and United are operating under 1 million seats a week with plans to cut even further in the coming weeks.

But it doesn't come close to matching the severe drop the airline industry is seeing. Daily passenger traffic through airports is less than 5% what it was a year ago, according to the Transportation Security Administration. Dallas Love Field, where Southwest is based, is only seeing about 1,500 passengers a day.

""The capacity cut, while substantial, is not nearly large enough to meet demand trends,"" said airline analyst Helane Becker with investment firm Cowen. ""Southwest's focus is on maintaining scheduling optionality for their customers despite there only being a few left.""

As recently as February, Southwest was the fourth-largest airline in the world behind American, United and Delta, according to OAG.

Southwest has been the slowest to react among the country's major airlines as the pandemic has obliterated the need for most of the country's airplanes. Southwest has parked at least 50 airplanes since the virus outbreak began. It also has been working to cut capacity by as much as 60% for the end of April and May."

205,205,https://motorbikewriter.com/warning-crowd-funded-bike-products/,Warning over crowd funded bike products,We warned about the crowd-funding campaign for RiderBuds earphones after customers had not received products almost a year after the promised delivery.,motorbikewriter.com,"We warned riders about supporting the crowd-funding campaign for RiderBuds earphones after customers had still not received products almost a year after the promised delivery date.

However, two customers in Holland and Canada have now contacted us to say they have finally received their RiderBuds and are happy with their performance.

We are satisfied they are legitimate customers and not linked with the RiderBuds company.

Originally company founder Maurice Dziubinski corresponded with us and even promised a review set. However, over the past year he has stopped replying to our frequent emails requesting updates on delivery.

That, plus the many comments from disappointed customers, made us understandably wary of this product.

Dutch customer Stephan says he ordered them on 22 February 2019 and was hoping they would be shipped during May 2019 as promised in the Indiegogo campaign launched in November 2018.

“I eventually received the RiderBuds on 25 March 2020, which is 13 months after I ordered them and 10 months late on their initial planning,” he says.

“I have to say, after they failed to deliver in May and the updates we received got less frequent, I started thinking I might have contributed to another scam on Indiegogo.

“When Maurice told us that 84% of top crowd funding projects are shipped late – often as much as one year late – I started to suspect things were not as they seemed. At that point I had completely given up on the product,” says Stephan who was caught by a crowd-funding product scam.

“I started to check the updates once every few months and when COVID-19 hit around the end of 2019 I thought that he had found the perfect excuse to delay delivery even further. Fortunately I was wrong and I actually received the product, which turns out to be great!”



He says he has used in-helmet speakers prior before that were “terrible”.

“I have a full face helmet and they do not have cut-outs for in helmet speakers, so my ears got sore,” he says.

“I tried using in-ear earbuds and they were even worse; dislodging, discomfort. So when I spotted RiderBuds I was sold.”

Our original article said the earphones ($US199, $A275, €175, £150) were claimed to be the smallest, softest, toughest, quietest and most secure earphones for riders.

They claimed they can’t be dislodged when putting on a helmet or pulling it off like most other earphones.,

The cable connections are also supposed to be tougher and won’t fray or break with rough use; even if you pull them out by the cable.

Like other previews of prospective motorcycle products, we included a warning to our readers that supporting a crowd-funding campaign for a product not yet manufactured is not without risk.

Kickstarter and Indiegogo do not offer refunds to supporters who pledge money for products that either fail to reach their goal or do reach their goal and then fail through fraud.

The latter was the case with the infamous Skully head-up display helmet where the founders blew $US2.4m in supporters’ money on fast cars and women!

Unless a crowd-funding campaign specifically mentions a refund, supporters are advised they will have to contact the campaigner to get their money back.

They are also notoriously late with delivery as has been experienced with RiderBuds.

Maurice told us on the launch of his campaign that he spent hundreds of hours testing the earphones, talked with more than 1000 riders around the world and had a few dozen Beta testers, including in Australia and New Zealand.

His crowd-funding campaign was fully subscribed in three hours, 200% in 12 hours and raised $A164,255 from 688 backers within a month.

The campaign page is still live and has now amassed more than $A220,000 from 885 backers.

We are surprised Indiegogo did not suspend the page and stop taking money after many complaints on the page from potential customers.

One comment came from a customer who suggested Maurice had moved from Hong Kong to Vietnam because of the COVID-19 outbreak and was getting the production sorted out.

The comments have now been deleted and replaced by “testimonials”."

Need eggs but trying to limit shopping trips during the coronavirus pandemic?

Perhaps a neighbor can help.

Retail giant Walmart and neighborhood-based social network Nextdoor announced a new program Thursday – dubbed “Neighbors Helping Neighbors” – that aims to make it easier for community members to help each other amid COVID-19.

With the program available in cities nationwide, Nextdoor members can request assistance or offer to help someone locally picking up groceries, medications and other essentials and then delivering them without contact.

In an exclusive interview with USA TODAY, Walmart Chief Customer Officer Janey Whiteside called the program “a hyperlocal way to pay it forward.” It also helps Walmart limit the number of shoppers in the company’s 5,000-plus U.S. stores, a measure rolled out April 4.

“The less people we can have in the store, the quicker we can get people in and out and the easier it is to adhere to social distancing guidelines,” Whiteside said. “We want everybody to get everything they want from Walmart but the less people we can have getting it for them, the better it is.”

Nextdoor CEO Sarah Friar said in recent weeks the San Francisco-based company has seen a 260% increase in members offering to help their neighbors. The ""neighborly touch"" can make all the difference to vulnerable people like seniors and those most susceptible to COVID-19, Friar said.

“There's something really important about the strength of proximity,” Friar told USA TODAY. “It's easy to do the service component, when it's someone who lives just down the street or maybe in the apartment building.”

Neighbors Helping Neighbors purchases are between Nextdoor members and different from Walmart’s delivery and pickup services, including curbside. The retailer started reserving an hour every morning for pickup orders for first responders and shoppers most at risk for the coronavirus April 14.

Whiteside said Nextdoor was Walmart’s ""partner of choice” because members are verified using their addresses and mobile numbers. “You know they're legit,” she said. “It's not somebody masquerading as wanting to help and trying to defraud you.”

Walmart and Nextdoor recommend using contact-free payment services like Venmo and Paypal instead of cash.

Friar said while the program is starting with Walmart it may be expanded to include other retailers.

“I think we're going to come out of this whole pandemic with a whole new appreciation for our neighborhood,"" Friar said.

If a Nextdoor member wants help shopping for needed items or wants to offer their help, they log on to Nextdoor.com or the Nextdoor app, available on both iOS and Android phones. Accounts need to be verified.

Members click on the recently launched “Groups” tab and will see Walmart stores in their area pinned to the top of the page. Walmart locations and hours where “Neighbors Helping Neighbors” is available can also be found on Nextdoor’s “Help Map.”

Members will then be prompted to share a message in the group feed to indicate if they need help or want to offer help.

Once members connect in the feed they can work out details of the shopping trip on the message board or direct message each other to work on the specifics.

Neighbors are encouraged to use contact-free payment options like Venmo or Paypal instead of cash and leave packages in front of the door.

207,207,http://www.comunicati.net/comunicati/arte/musica/blues/632009.html,"Cellulose Fiber Market – Outlook, Size, Share & Forecast 2018 To 2026",,www.comunicati.net,"Cellulose Fiber Market was valued at US$ 26.04 Bn in 2017 and is expected to reach US$ 49.49 Bn by 2026, at a CAGR of 8.36 % during a forecast period.

The objective of the report is to present a comprehensive assessment of the market and contains thoughtful insights, facts, historical data, industry-validated market data and projections with a suitable set of assumptions and methodology. The report also helps in understanding cellulose fiber market dynamics, structure by identifying and analyzing the market segments by fiber type, application, and region and, project the global market size. Further, report also focus on competitive analysis of key players by product, price, financial position, Materials portfolio, growth strategies and regional presence. The report also provide PEST analysis, PORTERâ€™s analysis, SWOT analysis to address question of shareholders to prioritizing the efforts and investment in near future to particular market segment.

Cellulose fibers are made up of esters or ether of the cellulose. Cellulose fibers are manufactured from dissolving pulp from cellulose rich plants such as cotton, jute, bamboo, flax, hemp, etc. Abundant availability of these plants shall influence the global cellulose fiber market size significantly in the forecast period. These fibers are versatile in nature and possess unique properties such as moisture absorbency, hydrophobicity, and so on. With impurities removed by a chemical step, fiber becomes greatly hydrophilic and its surface instantly wettable. Under ambient conditions, the material has a moisture regain (mass of water absorbed per dry mass of fiber, expressed as percentage) of about 8%, but when soaked in water the fiber can imbibe up to 30% fluid and swell significantly. One unique characteristic of cotton, related to its specific structure, is that it becomes stronger (by about 20%) when wet.

Increasing demand for cellulose fibers mainly from textile industry may foster the global cellulose fiber market growth in future. In addition, owing to its properties such as skin-friendly, biodegradable, and environment-friendly in nature, the growth in the market is expected to boost in forecast period. Moreover, significant consumption from the textile industries may influence the global market. Wood pulp is the key raw material used in the production of cellulose fibers, which is another major influential driver of the global market. However, the proliferation of new players entering the global cellulose fiber market may enhance the global cellulose fiber market in a positive way.

Rapidly changing fashion trends coupled with rising disposable income of people in many regions across the globe is increasing the demand for high quality textiles. This is increasing the demand for cellulosic fibres. Low cost of these fibres, on account of easy availability of raw materials, is fuelling their adoption across industries, thus augmenting their market growth. As technologies continue to advance, the application of these cellulose fibres will expand into wider industry verticals, thus driving their market over the projected period.

On the basis of fiber type, Natural cellulose fibers are derived from plants which are extracted & processed when needed. During the processing, they are separated from the rest of the plant which is not useful. The natural fiber market is expected to grow at a high CAGR by 2026 on account of various disadvantages of usage of synthetic fibers in various end-use industries. Natural cellulose fibers held the major share of the market in 2017, owing to its application in construction industry as reinforcement composite which can be used as ready mix plaster.

Textile was the prominent segment in 2017. The segment alone accounts for around 44% of the global revenue share. The major application of fibers in the textile industry is to reinforce composites and filter chemicals. Therefore, fiber produced from wood pulp is becoming an important element for the textile industry. Cotton is the major raw material for textile industry. However, declining cotton production owing to the difficulty in its cultivation has resulted in major growth in the demand for wood-based cellulose fibers. These are high-performing and find applications in industrial, Textile, apparel, etc.

Asia Pacific was the dominant region, owing to high demand in textile and industrial segment. The region is projected to show the same growth trend over the forecasted period due to rise in demand from industrial, textile and other application segments in the region. China, India, Japan, South Korea, Pakistan, Taiwan, and Indonesia are the major markets in the region. These countries are involved in manufacturing and trade of fibers, which are used across various end-use industries. Vietnam and Bangladesh are the potential future market for the product."
208,208,https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252482083/Ransomware-stricken-Travelex-up-for-sale,Ransomware-stricken Travelex up for sale,Travelex’s parent Finablr is washing its hands of the ransomware-stricken forex provider as it struggles with the twin shocks of the Covid-19 pandemic and a developing fraud scandal,www.computerweekly.com,"Stricken foreign exchange company Travelex, which was still recovering from a £25m hit after its systems were encrypted by Sodinokibi ransomware on 31 December 2019 when the international travel industry shut down thanks to the Covid-19 coronavirus pandemic, is up for sale.

Travelex staff were forced to use pen and paper to record cash-only transactions after its systems were shut down as a result of the attack, which left holidaymakers and business travellers stranded worldwide without access to funds, and also affected a number of retail banks, including Barclays and HSBC, which relied on Travelex for their own exchange services.

It later emerged that the firm had left disclosed flaws in its virtual private network (VPN) servers unpatched, meaning its networks were highly vulnerable to cyber attacks on a daily basis for eight months. Researchers at Bad Packets had even reached out to Travelex to try to inform them of this, but were ignored.

Travelex had only fully restored its systems as of 2 March 2020, barely a week before the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared the developing coronavirus crisis a full-blown pandemic. As an organisation that is highly dependent on the overall health of the travel industry, this means that Travelex has also been severely hit by the pandemic.

As of 17 March, the firm had said it was working with stakeholders to mitigate the challenges thrown up by the pandemic, but given the subsequent introduction of nationwide lockdowns worldwide and the suspension of all but essential travel, its supply of customers has virtually dried up.

In a brief statement, Travelex said: “The company announces that, as part of its continuing assessment of strategic options to maximise value for its stakeholders, the Board of Travelex Holdings Limited has decided to seek offers for the Travelex group, and has communicated this intention to [parent organisation] Finablr plc.

“Parties with a potential interest in making a proposal should contact PwC [PricewaterhouseCoopers] to enter into a customary non-disclosure agreement, following which they will receive certain information on the Travelex group, and will be invited to submit their indicative proposals to PwC on that basis.

“The company will continue to update stakeholders on the sale process and parallel discussions with creditors as appropriate.”

Finablr – which bought the firm from its founder, entrepreneur Lloyd Dorfman, in 2014 – first appointed auditors to prepare it for potential insolvency in March, saying that given its liquidity situation it wanted to “undertake rapid contingency planning for a potential insolvency appointment”.

It should be noted that the insolvency planning is at least in part related to the discovery of financial irregularities at Finablr unrelated to Travelex – group companies had kept millions of dollars worth of cheques secret from the board of the Abu Dhabi-based firm prior to a 2019 IPO.

Another Finablr group company, UAE Exchange, has since been taken under the control of the central bank of the United Arab Emirates, and a separate healthcare company founded by Finablr boss Bavaguthu Raghuram Shetty is also at the centre of a fraud scandal.

According to the Financial Times, the price of Travelex’s listed bonds stands at a quarter of debt face value, suggesting that there is no value for Finablr but maybe some for the bondholders.

Those who hold debt in Travelex could try to realise this by taking control of it, supporting its sale, or through a debt-for-equity swap, sources close to the talks told the newspaper."
209,209,https://www.pulse.com.gh/news/world/hong-kong-political-crisis-deepens-despite-protest-lull-during-virus/v3f4eb3,Hong Kong political crisis deepens despite protest lull during virus,A roundup of Hong Kong pro-democracy activists and a row over the powers of Beijing's office in the city have deepened the political crisis engulfing the financial hub even as a coronavirus lockdown prevents large-scale protests.,www.pulse.com.gh,"The mass demonstrations that convulsed the semi-autonomous Chinese city for seven straight months last year have dissipated during the COVID-19 crisis as cautious residents stick to social distancing.

But over the past week, political tensions have soared once more, threatening to upend the calm in a city still ruptured by ideological divides and where many fear China's strengthening grip is eroding their freedoms.

There is a ""new, gritty nastiness emerging"", risk management consultants Steve Vickers Associates warned in a note this week, and with neither Beijing nor the democracy camp willing to make compromises, future unrest was near inevitable.

On Sunday, police arrested 15 prominent activists on charges linked to last year's demonstrations.

Those detained were not masked protesters who often violently clashed with police, but rather some of the city's best-known moderates -- including former lawmakers, academics and a media tycoon.

Among them was 81-year-old barrister Martin Lee, who in the 1980s helped draft the ""Basic Law"" -- the city's mini-constitution that grants liberties and a high degree of autonomy unseen on the Chinese mainland.

The police swoop came during a row over whether Beijing was reinterpreting a key part of that document.

The spat began when the Liaison Office -- which represents China's central government -- issued a statement condemning pro-democracy lawmakers for filibustering in the legislature.

The office suggested the politicians had breached their oath of office and could be prosecuted.

That sparked accusations that Beijing had crossed a line.

While China's control over Hong Kong's foreign policy and defence is undisputed, Article 22 of the Basic Law forbids Beijing departments from ""interfering"" in areas where the city governs itself -- such as its legislature and separate judicial system.

As criticism mounted, the Liaison Office made a landmark announcement: it was not governed by the provision -- even though documents previously submitted to Hong Kong's legislature stated it was.

Instead, it argued it had a ""distinctive"" role and could exercise a ""supervisory power"" over the city.

Hong Kong's government deepened the confusion when it issued a statement initially saying the Liaison Office was governed by Article 22, only to retract it hours later and issue two more corrected versions.

The cabinet member whose office provided the advice for the initial statement was moved to a new position in a reshuffle on Wednesday, although city leader Carrie Lam denied it was linked to the furore.

Critics seized on the move as the latest attempt by Beijing to increase control over Hong Kong's politics.

The Progressive Lawyers Group called it ""brazen in its intention to tighten Beijing's grip on the city by unconstitutionally expanding the powers of the Liaison Office"".

And the Bar Association published a legal analysis concluding there was ""no question"" Beijing's offices in the city were bound by the non-interference clause.

Prominent activist Joshua Wong told AFP he believed China's leaders were taking advantage of the world being distracted by the pandemic.

""Beijing in the upcoming future will just strengthen and enhance interference in Hong Kong local affairs,"" he said.

Others disputed the idea that the Liaison Office crossed a legal rubicon.

""Merely commenting and expressing one's view on a matter of public interest would not count as intervention,"" Simon Young, a law professor at the University of Hong Kong, told AFP.

Jasper Tsang, a former president of Hong Kong's legislature and a pro-Beijing heavyweight, said the Liaison Office felt it had ""no choice"" but to wade into the paralysis in the legislature, which had left a dozen bills languishing for months.

Opponents are filibustering to delay a bill outlawing insults to the Chinese national anthem -- a serious provocation to Beijing.

Tsang said the Liaison Office would likely be more confrontational in future.

""How can you stop it?"" he said.

Expectations are now rising that last year's unrest will return, especially with legislative elections due in September, when the pro-democracy camp is hoping to score large gains.

Beijing has also made it clear it wants Hong Kong to have a new national security law -- a proposal that sparked huge protests in 2003.

Now, some dissidents have started calling for a protest on July 1 even if social distancing measures against the virus are still in place.

""Businesses should prepare for further civil unrest, as the threat from the virus recedes and friction rises,"" said Steve Vickers Associates."

Bottom line: Mitchell has been arreste",eurweb.com,"*Actor Jason Mitchell is in the news again and given that we’re talking about actor Jason Mitchell, the news is not good. Bottom line: Mitchell has been arrested for both drug and weapon possession.

The 33-year-old actor was taken into custody in Mississippi on Wednesday afternoon (04-22-20). “The Chi” actor was charged by the Harrison County Sheriff’s Office with four felony charges of possession of a controlled substance, which was marijuana, with the intent to distribute, weapon possession by a felon, possession by a felon and possession of a controlled substance, including ecstasy, with intent to distribute, according to The Blast.

The site’s report goes on to say that the weapons he had with him during his arrest included a controlled Glock 19 (usually referred to as a 9 mm semi-automatic pistol) and a mini draco (an AK-47 pistol). He was released Wednesday evening.

Mitchell’s arrest comes after he celebrated the birth of his son, which he shared the news of at the end of March, which was finally some good news for the troubled actor.

Mitchell who came to fame as Easy E in the mega-hit film “Straight Outta Compton,” has seen his career and life literally go south after he was accused of misconduct on the set of a Netflix film called “Desperados,” which he would be fired from. Subsequently, he was dropped from “The Chi” following claims that his behavior with co-star Tiffany Boone, as well as with Season 2 showrunner Ayanna Floyd. As a result of those actions and his attitude, he then lost his managerial and talent representation.

As far as his arrest is concerned, his rep has sent this statement to TMZ:

Jason is at home with his family right now, working on an amazing new project. News stories move fast and oftentimes without all of the facts. This misunderstanding will be resolved shortly. We trust that the court systems blind justice will protect Jason’s rights and allow him to tell his story.”

The rep did not get into specifics on the arrest or why Mitchell was charged, but continued, “During the Pandemic it’s best we focus on the importance of our Nation growing back to our full capacity.”

Speaking of TMZ, ironically, Jason mentions and blames the site when he briefly touched on his professional troubles in a “corona rap” challenge he started on his Instagram earlier this week, prior to his arrest.

“TMZ was f–kin’ with me/had to start back from the draw go hard, get smarter, trying to hold my head high/hopping out the [inaudible], own cousin sold me out to the blogs for a barter/Like LeBron, in the paint, how I’m fighting bogus charges/Just want a lump sum, a couple cars and be a good father to my daughters/So middle fingers up to whoever think I lost it,” he rapped."

Up to half of the people who died in Europe from the coronavirus were in nursing homes, a World Health Organization official said Thursday.

Dr. Hans Kluge, the agency’s Europe director, said a “deeply concerning picture” was emerging that showed the impact on nursing homes of the dangerous virus, which has killed than 110,000 Europeans, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.

Kluge noted that the care at these facilities has “often been notoriously neglected,” with employees overworked and underpaid.

He said these workers have been the “unsung heroes” of the pandemic, which has caused an “unimaginable tragedy” in the facilities.

The WHO official noted that the crisis appeared to be stabilizing in some regions, but the battle with the virus was far from over.

More than 1.1 million Europeans have become infected by the virus, with Spain, Italy and Germany being among the hardest hit, according to the ECDC."

The rapper, 36, who is currently in quarantine with his actress girlfriend Karima McAdams, took to Instagram on Thursday afternoon to share a shirtless snap and reveal he wants to fast by means of 'rebooting his body'.

After sharing a lengthy caption, the star, real name Stephen Manderson, was forced to hit back at critics who accused him of 'trivialising' Ramadan.

Ramadan is the ninth month of the Islamic calendar, observed by Muslims worldwide as a month of fasting, prayer, reflection and community.

This year it will begin on Thursday and last until Saturday May 23.

He wrote: 'Tomorrow I’m beginning Ramadan for the first time in my life. I’m really interested in the freedom that I hope will come from ridding myself of habits, addictions and mental ties that I haven’t quite managed to severe...

'A reboot. A respect for my body and what goes into it. A respect for my mind and detachment from the reward system that is my phone...

'A reminder of what my body actually needs, discipline in place of the cravings I feed daily. I’m still going to have to work, but I’m keeping contact to an absolute minimum. The relevance of this pic?...

'Despite working out a LOT (you’d never know looking at me) I’ve been delving into the snack cupboard when the sun goes down most days. I don’t feel bad about it at all - neither should you, we’re in the middle of a pandemic...

'I am however interested to see what change there will be physically. Im currently 83kg, by eye I reckon about 15% body fat (distributed mostly around my lower abdominal area suggesting high cortisol - stress, lack of sleep and crisp eating)...

'Let’s see where I am in 31 days. Hopefully happier and healthier - have a google about the many benefits of fasting. You don’t need an app, or even a watch. Just the sun and some will power.'

When a critic hit out at the star for deciding to share the news, he responded: 'God forbid you inspire anyone else'.

Another follower wrote: 'Ramadan has a huge amount of religious and cultural significance that this post completely overlooks...

'I think it’s important not to trivialise the practice of Ramadan as a health-based intermittent fasting experiment.'

Disgruntled by the criticism, he responded: 'I’m in a Muslim country, in a muslim household. I’m learning. The post doesn’t overlook anything and there’s nothing trivial about my endeavours.'

Karima and Professor Green went public in June last year and have been sharing snaps from their lockdown in Morocco.

The gorgeous 19-year-old model slipped into a sleek black outfit that showed some skin, posing for a half-body shot that flaunted both her slim figure and elegant glam for her audience to admire.

Since the photo captured her from the waist up, it was unclear whether Tarsha wore a dress, a bodysuit, or simply a long top. However, fans could plainly see the gorgeous blonde rocked a long-sleeved, mock-turtleneck number that fit tightly across her perky chest. Snapped from the profile, the Aussie beauty showed off her sculpted waist in the skintight attire, while also teasing a glimpse of her pert derrière. Although the look was a lot more conservative compared to the seductive outfits fans are used to seeing on her feed, the outfit grabbed attention with a large cutout along the side, exposing quite a bit of her toned midriff. A chic lace-up panel adorned the gash, tying around the back with a large, loopy bow and calling even further attention to her bared skin.

Tarsha opted for a face full of makeup in the shot, emphasizing her deep brown eyes with a shimmering skin-toned eyeshadow and bold faux eyelashes. Her glossy lipstick was a matching, slightly darker color that added extra fullness to her plump lips. She illuminated her bronze tan with a peach blush and plenty of highlighter, finishing off her glam look with dark eyeliner. The stunner showed off her impeccable sense of style by harmonizing her jewelry with the palette of her makeup. She wore chunky hoop earrings in a bronze color, which sported a textured design that contrasted with the smooth fabric of her attire. Her long golden tresses were pulled up into a half ponytail, cascading down her back in sumptuous curls.

The model was photographed in low light, with the flash serving to illuminate her face and figure. A simple white interior — that barely showed any furniture — made up the background, keeping the focus entirely on Tarsha. The Instagram star posed with both arms raised at waist level and looked over her shoulder, giving off sultry vibes as she fixed the camera with an intense gaze. She tilted her head backwards slightly and parted her lush lips in a provocative way.

Tarsha captioned the photo with a suggestive eyes emoji meant to call attention to her stirring gaze. The upload elicited quite the reaction from her followers, amassing more than 7,900 likes and 122 comments in just one hour.

“Get out of here u hotty [sic],” wrote one person, adding a fire emoji for emphasis.

“You’re out of this world.” a third fan gushed, leaving a heart-eyes emoji at the end of their post.

“Your eyes baby,” commented a fourth follower, bumping up the number of heart-eyes emoji to two."

Only one of the positive patients is from elsewhere in the district (Dooru area). The rest of the nine are from the same village, Nowgam in Shangus area, where the 41 year old “ spreader” lives.

He contracted the infection from a baker’s shop in Anantnag town, where he worked and unaware of the condition he went back home to live among his family and friends. He was tested positive on around April 15.

On April 18, Kashmir Reader did a story on how he could turn out to be a “super spreader” given his unbridled contact history. This newspaper reported how he complained of diarrhea a few days after he went home.

The man in subsequent days had visited a Primary Health Centre (PHC) in Nowgam, a private doctor’s clinic and then the district hospital Anantnag for his treatment.

Soon after he was tested positive, more than 257 of his primary, secondary and tertiary contacts were tracked and put under quarantine. Samples were taken from them and so far eight have tested positive of the virus.

The Nodal Officer for COVID-19 in Anantnag, Peer Farhat, confirmed it. “8 of his contacts have so far tested positive. This includes none of his family members,” Farhat said, “All of them are doing fine for now,”

He said that around 125 test reports are still awaited from the samples taken from his contacts.

“We have our fingers crossed. Hope all of them turn out to be negative,” Farhat said.

The challenge however has gotten bigger as the administration now is trying to track down the contacts of the 8 people tested positive for COVID-19, who are obviously going to run into hundreds.

With the district administration the people of Anantnag have their fingers crossed as well."
220,220,https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2020/04/23/russia-to-adopt-moscows-digital-pass-system-for-coronavirus-lockdown-a70078,Russia to Adopt Moscow’s Digital Pass System for Coronavirus Lockdown,Officials warn that the regions’ hospitals risk running out of hospital beds within three to four weeks at current rates.,www.themoscowtimes.com,"At least 21 Russian regions have requested digital travel passes a week after coronavirus-hit Moscow enacted its system to enforce lockdown measures and slow the deadly outbreak, the Communications and Press Ministry said Wednesday. Their introduction beyond Moscow comes as health officials warn that the regions lag behind the Russian capital in new infection rates by two to three weeks on average. The city of 12.5 million currently accounts for more than half of Russia’s 57,999 coronavirus cases and 547 deaths.

The rest of Russia needs digital passes “so that we could see the traffic, its volume and the travelers,” Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin, who also leads the Russian government’s coronavirus task force, said. “I believe [the system] can be extended… to control the movement of air, rail and intercity and inter-regional bus transport,” Interfax quoted Sobyanin as saying. Seven regions immediately surrounding Moscow will become the first to connect to the digital pass system, the communications ministry said. Fourteen other regions further afield, including in the North Caucasus, Siberia and the Far East, will introduce digital travel passes next week. The technology will be based on a smartphone app used by the Moscow region. The region’s pilot program has issued almost 1 million multiple-use passes and hands out around 400,000 single-use passes daily.

Sobyanin warned that the regions’ hospitals risk running out of beds within three to four weeks at current rates of infection. Critics have derided the passes, which control most movement with the exception of foot travel (Muscovites are banned from walking anywhere outside grocery shops, pharmacies or to walk dogs within a 100-meter radius of their homes), as unconstitutional mass surveillance that could remain in place after the coronavirus outbreak. Moscow's system was also heavily criticized last week when footage showed large crowds of people queued outside metro station entrances as they waited to have their passes checked. Russia confirmed 5,236 new coronavirus infections on Wednesday, bringing the country’s official number of cases to 57,999."

""I am not a private owner. That's the competition in this country. The free enterprise and to be able to make sure that what you offer the public meets the needs of the public,"" Goodman, an independent, told CNN's Anderson Cooper.

""Right now, we're in a crisis health-wise, and so for a restaurant to be open or a small boutique to be open, they better figure it out. That's their job. That's not the mayor's job.""

Goodman does not have the power to order Las Vegas' casinos to reopen and her comments are at odds with the reopening guidelines issued by the state's Gaming Control Board, which will ultimately sign off on a plan to have the iconic Sin City businesses running again.

Those guidelines ask businesses to send in reopening plans at least seven days before resuming operations.

The board also lists procedures that businesses should follow when reopening including complying with all prescribed local, state and federal Covid-19 heath requirements.

Democratic Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak said on Tuesday that casino owners are working together on coming up with a plan on how to protect their customers when they eventually do open.

The state plans to follow the federal government's guidelines on reopening the economy from stay-at-home orders, a crucial part of which is declining reports of new cases for 14 consecutive days. Sisolak described the state as being in ""phase zero"" on Tuesday and he did not give a date on when to expect reopenings to begin.

Still, Goodman's comments come as more states plan phased reopenings of their economies even as public health experts have repeatedly stressed the dangers of relaxing social distancing measures too early.

There has been a disconnect between some Democratic mayors and Republican governors on how to safely reopen areas under stay-at-home orders to limit the spread of the coronavirus.

Governors in Georgia and South Carolina announced plans earlier this week to allow businesses to reopen in their states, but have faced pushback from mayors who don't believe it's safe to open businesses like gyms, tattoo parlors, nail salons and other places deemed nonessential in initial orders.

The pandemic has proved catastrophic to the nation's economy, including in places like Las Vegas where businesses that are core to the city's identity -- namely casinos, hotels and theaters -- are closed.

""I want everything back. We never closed down the United States. We've never closed down Nevada. We've never closed down Las Vegas because that's our job. Entertainment capital of the world where everything is clean,"" Goodman said, without providing any examples of guidance the city government would give casinos or hotels on how to limit coronavirus' spread inside their facilities.

When pressed by Cooper about the dangers of such a move, Goodman said ""it sounds like you're being an alarmist,"" and cited her ""long life"" as the credentials for her thought process.

""I grew up in the heart of Manhattan. I knew what it's like to be in subways and on buses and crammed into elevators,"" she said.

But public health experts widely agree that to control the epidemic in the absence of strict social distancing measures, states and localities will need to build the capacity for additional testing and contact tracing.

Goodman said Wednesday that while testing is ""important"" it's ""not my job, unfortunately.""

In fact, the Las Vegas mayor appeared to signal interest in the city becoming a control group without social distancing measures to compare against other regions with strict guidelines.

""I offered to be a control group and I was told by our statistician you can't do that because people from all parts of southern Nevada come in to work in the city and I said, 'Oh, that's too bad because I know when you have a disease, you have a placebo that gets the water and the sugar and then you get those that actually get the shot,'"" she said.

""We would love to be that placebo side so you have something to measure against."""

 MotoGP logistics: behind the scenes on the road back from Qatar 

 

 The QNB Grand Prix of Qatar took place just as much of the world began to see travel restrictions brought into force to limit the spread of Covid-19, changing the face of the world almost instantly and creating some complex logistical challenges for the MotoGP World Championship. Compounded by the fact that the premier class were unable to return to Losail International Circuit and yet their equipment remained in Doha following the earlier test held at the venue, there were three classes of freight for MotoGP, team and DHL logistics personnel to pack and repatriate to Europe  a task that has now been completed.

 

 Initially a normal timetable was maintained upon completion of the Qatar GP, ensuring all the material was put on pallets and ready to fly to its next destination within a regular timeframe. Under normal circumstances, the freight would have then travelled to the next GP on flights leaving in the subsequent days, but this time it was instead put into storage at Doha airport awaiting more updates on where it would next be required and when. Thanks to partner Qatar Airways; highly-secure, automated and climate-controlled space was provided for the freight at Hamad International Airport  crucial for much of the material as it was protected from both humidity and any changes in ambient temperature, keeping it safe and secure.

 

 With flights repatriating material from Doha to Spain in extremely high demand, Dorna Sports then worked with Qatar Airways to secure the five flights of freight that were required to repatriate all the material. The first was able to begin returning the goods on the 1st of April, followed by the second and third on the 8th and 10th of April, respectively  all of which landed in Zaragoza. A flight to Barcelona on the 12th of April then completed four fifths of the task before the final flight landed in Zaragoza on Wednesday the 22nd of April to complete the repatriation.

 

 Once each plane load of material was back in Europe, it was transferred to a secure storage facility in Catalonia on arrival. Some of it will be kept in storage awaiting the next Grand Prix, including much of Dornas equipment, whilst much will now be returned to those who have requested it be transferred to their own facilities for storage.

 

 Once the date and location of the next Grand Prix are confirmed, Dorna Sports and logistics partner DHL will resume normal service to continue transporting MotoGP around the world.

Of the infected patients, 26 personnel are from Gazipur police, 16 from Narayanganj police, 18 from Gopalganj police. Cases remained in single digits in other districts.

Police have been working amid the coronavirus crisis risking their lives and getting infected, only to serve the people while they set an example to follow, the police headquarters said in a statement.

The protective gear is in high demand around the world, and Bangladesh is not an exception to it, said the statement. The majority of 200,000 police personnel are working at the field level to prevent the coronavirus from spreading, in addition to continuing their regular responsibilities of enforcing the law and order.

They are providing protection to people and organisations related to food, medicine and other emergency services , controlling the price gouging, hoarding of goods and also taking stringent measures to prevent irregularities in the distribution of TCB goods, according to the statement.

Police are also risking their lives while burying those who died from the coronavirus.

As of Apr 23, 218 police including constables and higher officials have been infected. Another 652 have been quarantined, the statement said. Proper arrangement has been made to ensure the treatment of these infected police, following the directive from the prime minister.

Police hospitals were prepared to serve them and Inspector General Benazir Ahmed is providing necessary directives, according to the statement."
224,224,https://www.elle.com/fashion/a32252615/london-fashion-week-digital-gender-neutral/,London Fashion Week Goes Digital And Gender Neutral Due To Covid-19,The BFC announced Men's fashion week in June will be both digital and gender neutral.,www.elle.com,"Almost forty years since the British Fashion Council held their first London Fashion Week, they have announced that the quarterly event, historically divided by gender, as well as season, will become gender-neutral and commence digitally, due to the pandemic.

During the month in which London Fashion Week Men’s would have occurred—beginning June 12—a digital London Fashion Week will instead take place, hosted on londonfashionweek.co.uk, with both menswear and womenswear designers showcasing.

The virtual event will include, ""interviews, podcasts, designer diaries, webinars and digital showrooms,"" and be open to everyone, welcoming both industry insiders and fashion consumers.

""It is essential to look at the future and the opportunity to change, collaborate and innovate,"" BFC Chief Executive Caroline Rush said in a statement. ""The current pandemic is leading us all to reflect more poignantly on the society we live in and how we want to live our lives and build businesses when we get through this.""

""Designers will be able to share their stories, and for those that have them, their collections, with a wider global community; we hope that as well as personal perspectives on this difficult time, there will be inspiration in bucketloads. It is what British fashion is known for.""

The merging of Men's and Women's fashion weeks this summer will not, however, signal the cancellation of September's London Fashion Week. Instead, this new set up will encourage flexibility for designers within an increasingly demanding schedule.

""This will no doubt be an interesting time for brands to test new models, and think about how they can really connect with their customers."" ELLE UK's Fashion Features Editor Sara McAlpine said of the digital shift.

""It’s challenging, of course, but a number of designers are already connecting digitally in new and exciting ways, whether it’s honing in on craft as Alexander McQueen has with its online Makers series, or fostering a sense of community and driving a set of values, like Kenneth Ize, who shares clips of his production process, spotlighting sustainability, and encourages followers to share their looks with the #KennethLovesYou hashtag.""



Criticisms of fashion weeks have been mounting over the last few seasons, owing to their cost, carbon footprint, and the sheer size of production; They've been charged with promoting detrimental environmental practices and ineffective business models for fashion brands.

Taking the events online, like Shanghai Fashion Week did in March, may be a viable solution to these problems moving forward, pandemic or not.

But we sure will miss the street style shots.

Majdalani's ministry is responsible for collecting data on families affected by job losses related to COVID-19 in order to organize cash and food assistance for them, Majdalani remarked.

Some 53,000 Palestinian families have fallen below the poverty line since PA President Mahmoud Abbas announced the state of emergency. The total number of households living in poverty currently stands at 115,000, Social Affairs Minister Ahmad Majdalani said at a press conference in Ramallah on April 15. “These figures could increase at the end of the month,” he stated. Of the total recorded, 80,000 are in Gaza.

Gaza recorded its first case of the novel coronavirus on March 22, prompting Hamas, which controls the territory, to issue orders the same day shutting down all cafes. Mansour complained, “It has been weeks since I became forcibly unemployed. No one has offered me any assistance.”

Among those struggling is Fares Mansour, who recently had to sell his wife's engagement ring to put food on the table for her and his four children. “I used to work in a restaurant in Gaza City for 30 shekels [$9] per day, which, even then, was not enough to meet my family’s daily needs,” he said. “Yet, the restaurant, as well as other diners, closed since COVID-19 cases were confirmed in the Palestinian territories. Like the rest of the restaurants’ workers, I became unemployed.”

GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip — The state of emergency declared March 5 by the Palestinian Authority (PA) after COVID-19 cases were confirmed in Bethlehem and the subsequent lockdown have disrupted local economies and prevented laborers from going to work in Gaza, the West Bank and Israel. In the Palestinian territories, the economic hardship stemming from the pandemic serves to exacerbate problems for Palestinians already suffering from prolonged economic crisis, raising concerns of families not having access to sufficient food or financial aid programs.

“Preparations are underway to launch a program designed to help women working in nurseries,” Majdalani remarked. “About 1,245 women employed in 265 nurseries, which shut their doors to prevent COVID-19 from spreading among the children, were identified.” Such women are likely the main economic providers for the families.

Despite the hardship imposed by the shutdowns, Naser Qatami, deputy labor minister in Ramallah, told Al-Monitor, “It was of utmost necessity for the workers to be quarantined at home in order to win the fight against the coronavirus.”

He explained that workers and those in close contact with them constituted up to 75% of the coronavirus cases in the Palestinian territories, at the time 230 of the 307 confirmed cases. “The vast majority of the infected laborers were working in Israel, and they caught the virus while there,” he claimed. Two hundred twelve cases stemmed from Palestinians working in Israel.

According to Qatami, some 180,000 West Bank Palestinians were working in Israel, and around 150,000 of them returned to the Palestinian territories and self-quarantined. The rest ignored the PA’s call to remain at home and self-isolate, choosing instead to remain in Israel in the hope of continuing to earn much-needed money.

Qatami remarked that his ministry will soon launch a fund to provide monthly financial assistance to laborers no longer able to work. The first phase will cover 30,000 workers and by the end of the year include all affected workers. A worker whose family falls below the poverty line could thus receive monthly assistance from both the Social Affairs Ministry and the Labor Ministry.

Meanwhile, UNRWA, the United Nations Relief and Works Administration, has faced difficulties raising funds to help combat the coronavirus epidemic. Adnan Abu Hasna, an UNRWA spokesman in Gaza, told Al-Monitor, “We made an appeal to the world that they provide us with an emergency budget of $14 million to fight the coronavirus and its repercussions in the 58 Palestinian refugee camps located in our five areas of operation. Yet, we only obtained 30% of the amount, which was allocated to the health sector.”

He said there are no relief and food programs to provide additional assistance to the families of those who lose jobs because of the epidemic. According to Abu Hasna, UNRWA provides food aid to about 900,000 registered refugees in the West Bank and Gaza who are living below the poverty line, but cannot add the newly poor because its own financial crisis.

The limitations of official Palestinian and NGO efforts in dealing with the repercussions of the coronavirus outbreak have prompted activists and volunteers to launch individual initiatives to collect donations from the more fortunate and distribute them to poor families now without a source of income.

In one week, Zaki Madoukh along with other volunteers in Gaza City managed to collect $12,000 in donations from businesspeople inside and outside Gaza. They then used the funds to prepare and distribute baskets of food, including meat and vegetables, to less-fortunate shop owners.

Madoukh told Al-Monitor, “Our volunteer initiative targeted the owners of small enterprises whose work stopped because of the coronavirus in the Gaza Strip.” The initiative is ongoing."

""In order to protect our great American workers, Ive just signed an executive order temporarily suspending immigration into the United States, the president said during the coronavirus taskforce briefing at the White House. This will ensure that unemployed Americans of all backgrounds will be first in line for jobs as our economy reopens.""

Trump had said earlier this week that immigration would be suspended for at least 60 days in order to make sure Americans laid off during the coronavirus pandemic are first in line for new jobs. Trump has said the ban would be reevaluated after he looks at unemployment and economic figures.



Enjoy the total meltdown from the Dems today! 



And at the top of the lists for employment, the first of the firsts, should be our military vets...the men and women who have served this nation, the USA.

And she said people should not expect to resume life as it used to be.

During her Wednesday morning report, Schweitzer said the number of COVID-19 cases in Seneca County is holding steady at 11.

“As of today (Wednesday), we have 11 cases, one deceased, one hospitalized and eight have recovered,” she said. She said a recovered person is one who has been without symptoms for seven days and without fever for the three days without the use of fever-reducing medications.

As the state makes decisions about re-opening, Schweitzer said she and other county heath commissioners met with Ohio Department of Health Director Dr. Amy Acton Sunday via conference call.

She said Acton’s message was that life will not go back to the way it was before the pandemic.

“Things will not go back to the way we were used to,” Schweitzer said. “She (Acton) said there’s decisions that have to be made and we all know that. Those decisions won’t be perfect. Not everyone will be on the same page.

“Our trip back is going to be a little rocky and bumpy, but the important things is we all need to work together to make that happen,” she said.

At the state level, Schweitzer said official are working hard to get information out soon.

“I’m going to admit I’m very concerned that when we open up there will be more people getting out of course, and there could be an increase in cases,” she said.

Schweitzer reviewed the steps that must be taken.

“Everyone must wear a mask when they are out in public,” she said. “That is going to be crucial.”

She said one person wearing a mask helps and two people wearing masks doubles the protection, and adding the 6-foot distance add another layer. She said adding layers is the goal such as washing and sanitizing hands and disinfecting common areas.

“We’ve been promoting that from the beginning and we can’t let up just because things are going to be opening up,” she said. “It’s going to be more crucial now that we stick with those measures.”

Schweitzer said the public should remember there are many people who are infected with the virus, but show no symptoms.

“They can pass it on to others without even knowing it,” she said.

When wearing a mask, she said people should make sure they are breathing through it and it covers their mouth and nose. Masks should not be used on children younger than 2.

After returning home, she said masks should be disinfected with a 10% bleach solution.

Schweitzer said people with COVID-19 are showing a range of symptoms. Fever, cough and difficulty breathing are common but other people are showing chills, muscle pain and loss of taste and smell, among others.

She also said the number of tests available might be opening up soon.

“I want to thank everyone for their patience through this,” she said. “I know much of it seems so unfair.

“What I hope may results from all of this is that we help each other, look out for each other, assist each other where we can,” she said. “We have been working together to flatten the curve, and in this next phase, the challenge is going to be to stop the spread.”"

During the coronavirus pandemic, it is therefore going to be a very different experience.",www.hrmagazine.co.uk,"How HR can help Muslims during an unusual Ramadan

Ramadan has always been a communal event, impacting approximately 1.8 billion Muslims globally. During the coronavirus pandemic, it is therefore going to be a very different experience.

Ramadan is a month of fasting for those physically able to fast, from sunrise to sunset, where Muslims abstain from food and drink and sexual relations.

It also involves controlling oneself by abstaining from anger, rudeness, lying, cheating and practising patience and self reflection to effectively reset the body physically, emotionally and spiritually.

Fasting is one of five pillars of faith including the belief in One God and His final Messenger, Muhammed, praying five times a day throughout the day, giving money to charity and performing the pilgrimage to Mecca if one is able to do so. Many of the pillars have a communal aspect of bringing worshippers together as one in their belief in the oneness of God.

Ramadan is considered a sacred month during which the Quran, the literal Word of God, was revealed to Muhammed (peace be upon him).

During this month, Muslims who are physically able to, would normally open their fasts collectively with family and friends or at mosques with other members of the congregation. The mosques would be typically packed with worshippers engaged in communal prayer during the evening into the early hours of the morning.



Due to coronavirus, mosques are currently closed. Many will be affected by COVID-19 and those with symptoms may not be physically able to fast this year nor would they be required to.

The sense of isolation will be more notable for Muslim worshippers who have always enjoyed the communal elements of Ramadan but being at home allows for more time to spend in self reflection, contemplation and spiritual awakening through reading the Quran and prayer.

Many Muslims in the workplace will be fasting and with the fast starting approximately 4am and lasting until approximately 8pm, it will mean many Muslims will be fasting whilst working.

This year, many Muslims will be working from home whereby some aspects of the fasting element will be easier without the commute, but there is a lot an employer can do to engage and support its Muslim workforce.

Sleep deprivation is likely to be a factor more so than hunger and thirst, so as an employer if you are able to offer flexible working you can support your Muslim employees by enabling them to rest when required. This will in turn help them to stay productive during their working hours.

Your business can also accommodate its Muslim workers by having online meetings later in the day rather than the morning. However, these would have to take place no later than 6pm as this would be nearing the end of the fast. This flexibility would also help them to pray during the working day.

As an employer you might need to remind your Muslim workers to take regular breaks away from their screens as they will not be stopping during the day for food, coffee breaks or comfort breaks like their colleagues.

During the month of Ramadan, the 27th night is especially sacred as it was the night the Quran was first revealed and is described as the Night of Power. Many Muslims choose to spend this night in worship so are very likely to need to catch up on their sleep the next day. They therefore may request time off the next day.

Ramadan this year will start 23rd April (depending on the sighting of the moon) and lasts for 29 or 30 days. It ends with a celebration called Eid ul Fitr that begins with a communal prayer and time spent with family and loved ones. Expect holiday requests during the last 10 days of Ramadan and especially for the Eid day celebration.

Employers need to comply with the Equality Act 2010 ensuring no one is disadvantaged in the work place due to their religion or belief. Employers are not legally required to grant leave requests on religious grounds but some flexibility can greatly increase morale, yet of course all requests will need to be balanced against business needs.

Having this conversation early can help you to be adaptive, ensuring your business is able to deliver whilst being a great way to engage with your Muslim employees.

Being conscious that your business clients, customers, suppliers and other stakeholders may also have fasting employees can ensure that all parts of your business are considered to ensure that the business can continue to work effectively.

Having a proactive, inclusive approach sends a clear message to your Muslim employees that they matter and that you care.

236,236,https://www.statesboroherald.com/local/trump-disagrees-strongly-georgias-plan-reopen/,Trump 'disagrees strongly' with Georgia's plan to reopen,"ATLANTA — President Donald Trump said Wednesday that he ""disagreed strongly"" with the decision by Georgia's Republican governor to reopen salons, gyms and other nonessential businesses later this week, saying, ""It's just too soon.""",www.statesboroherald.com,"ATLANTA — President Donald Trump said Wednesday that he ""disagreed strongly"" with the decision by Georgia's Republican governor to reopen salons, gyms and other nonessential businesses later this week, saying, ""It's just too soon.""



Trump's comments at a daily White House briefing marked an abrupt shift in tone. Just last week, the president urged his supporters on Twitter to protest against statewide closures in three Democratic-led states — at the same time that mostly Republican governors like Brian Kemp were taking steps to lift stay-at-home restrictions.

Kemp announced earlier this week that as of Friday, elective medical procedures could resume in Georgia, and that barbershops, nail salons and gyms could reopen with restrictions. Limited in-restaurant dining is scheduled to resume on Monday.

The announcement immediately prompted pushback by Atlanta's Democratic mayor, other political opponents and health experts who warned that the state has not yet taken the steps recommended under federal guidelines to reopen the economy safely.

Georgia ranks in the bottom 10 U.S. states in per capita testing for the coronavirus. Officials are struggling to increase testing for new infections and boost tracking of those in contact with infected people. If that isn't done, health officials said, the state risks a quick rebound of COVID-19.

""The virus moves faster than government does,"" said Dr. Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. ""So if I had to bet on who would come out of the gate faster, it would be the virus.""

Trump has been stressing the importance of reopening states sooner than later to get the U.S. economy back on track and his administration recently announced a three-phase plan for making that happen. He also had health experts working with his administration present a lengthy briefing last week to show that states would have the testing capacity necessary to track and contain infections and start lifting restrictions.

But on Wednesday, he said he told Kemp that he had misgivings over the governor's plan to reopen quickly. He also said that he would not stand in his way.

""I want him to do what he thinks is right,"" Trump said. ""But I disagree with him on what he's doing. ... I think (opening) spas and beauty salons and tattoo parlors and barbershops in phase one ... it's just too soon.""

Kemp responded in a tweet Wednesday night that he appreciated Trump's guidance but would move forward with his plan.

""Our next measured step is driven by data and guided by state public health officials,"" the governor said. ""I am confident that business owners who decide to reopen will adhere to minimum basic operations, which prioritize the health and well-being of employees and customers.""

Trump's reopening guidelines recommend 14 days of declining new infections before moving to the reopening phase that Kemp has called for. That means testing health care workers and people showing symptoms, as well as screening others not showing symptoms.

The number of tests administered in Georgia had plateaued between 3,500 to 4,000 a day. However, on Wednesday, the state reported almost 6,000 tests over 24 hours, with Kemp saying on a conference call with Republican U.S. Sen. Kelly Loeffler that Georgia was ""really ramping up"" its capacity.

State Public Health Commissioner Kathleen Toomey said the state will expand its ability to ""aggressively"" trace the contacts of infected people.

""This is the way we're going to keep spread from occurring, even as we begin to gradually open up the state,"" Toomey said.

As of Wednesday, more than 21,000 people in Georgia had been infected with the virus and more than 840 had died, according to the state Department of Public Health.

Sean Bear, an epidemiologist with the department's eight-county district that includes Savannah, said intensive contact tracing has likely helped slow infections in his region. Bear said the coastal district kept tracking contacts, unlike areas where rising caseloads forced officials to largely stop.

The state hasn't said how many people are tracing contacts now, how many it seeks, or how quickly the state's 18 public health districts can ramp up.

Toomey and Kemp said the state will use a cellphone app to track infected people, and ask those people to voluntarily share cellphone data so that the state can find other contacts.

In announcing his reopening plan, Kemp remarked, ""There are a lot of people that are hurting really bad right now on the financial end of things — our hard-working Georgians. And we're trying to do all we can to allow them to start moving back into the work force in a limited and safe way.""

Many businesses and workers are holding back for fear of illness.

Dewond Brown, 42, was laid off in March from an Atlanta-area restaurant as a line cook making $16.40 hourly.

Worried about his high blood pressure, he said he wouldn't go back if his employer reopened. He said he would want to know coworkers tested negative and see a sharp drop in new cases.

""I understand everybody wants to get back to normal, but you hear the medical people say everyday it's not time yet,"" he said."

In its next Annual Plan, the Manawatū District Council had proposed a 4.6 per cent average rates increase to fund infrastructure projects due to rapid growth.

The move to ditch the increase translates into lost revenue of about $1.6 million and includes no pay rises for council staff next year.

Councils around New Zealand are weighing up similar proposals to ease financial burdens for homeowners affected by Covid-19 and the national lockdown.

During a remote council meeting on Thursday, councillors unanimously rejected the proposed 4.6 per cent hike.

They voted to recoup most of the lost revenue by draining an emergency fund, set up to provide money in emergency events as an alternative to borrowing.

However, the move has been labelled ""short-sighted"" and ""negligent"" by some in the community.

Halcombe Development Group chairwoman Janette Henderson told councillors the emergency reserve was for unforeseen disasters. Although Covid-19 could be classed as one, it was not a storm or natural disaster with immediate remedial spending requirements.

With salary freezes expected to save $200,000, Henderson believed the remaining shortfall should be funded by cutting non-essential projects, not deferring them.

However the council remains committed to completing those projects, such as strengthening the Feilding Library and council building, and a makeover of Turners Rd.

Henderson requested the council reduce department budgets by 3 per cent, which could save $1.64m.

""This more than covers the $1.4m shortfall and it could even allow $240,000 to be added to the emergency reserve,"" she said.

""This is not a rainy day. This is a day that needs shrewd and sensible decision making, not short-term knee jerk reactions.""

Councillors praised the move, saying it balanced the need to look after ratepayers and fuel the recovery.

Although the average rates would not increase, deputy mayor Michael Ford said rates for each property would still vary based on changes in property values, which were assessed in August.

Some commercial and rural properties had lower increases in their rating values than Feilding residential properties.

""I am pleased that several of the CBD business, commercial and industrial ratepayers will receive a reduction in rates. In my opinion, they have been paying too much prior anyway, and will be some of the hardest hit financially by this pandemic.""

""We have a couple of examples of between 4 per cent and 5 per cent increases, which at least is a lot more palatable than the 7 to11 per cent that they were facing if we had gone with an average rates increase of 4.6 per cent,"" Ford said.

""Feilding residential ratepayers have enjoyed large increases in the value of their properties since mid-2015, so will have to accept a modest increase in rates.""

Councillor Stuart Campbell said the council had created a ""cash cushion"" by creating the emergency fund. The fund has $800,000."

239,239,https://www.thejournal.ie/ryanair-eu-court-5082006-Apr2020/,EU's top court issues ruling that'll change how Ryanair and other airlines advertise air fares,An Italian watchdog had claimed Ryanair’s practices misled consumers and distorted competition with other airlines.,www.thejournal.ie,"THE EU’s TOP court has issued a ruling which will change how Ryanair and some other airlines advertise their air fares.

The Court of Justice of the EU has directed that airlines must indicate the fees charged for paying by credit card as well as the VAT on domestic flights from the first time their prices are published on the internet.

The CJEU said airlines must also indicate any check-in fees payable at the start of a booking process where no method of checking-in free of charge is offered as an alternative.

The ruling arises from a challenge by Ryanair against a fine of over €500,000 imposed in 2011 by Italy’s competition and market authority for engaging in unfair and misleading commercial practices, mostly relating to how the airline advertised its fares to consumers.

The Italian consumer watchdog considered Ryanair’s online check-in fees, the fees charged when paying by a credit card other than that approved by Ryanair and the VAT on domestic flights as unavoidable and foreseeable charges which should be notified to consumers before a booking process was commenced.

The issue was referred to the CJEU in Luxembourg for clarity on EU legislation governing air transport by the Italian Council of State after Ryanair had appealed a ruling by a regional court in Lazio which upheld a finding by the Italian competition and market authority that the airline was guilty of five separate unfair commercial practices.

The competition watchdog claimed Ryanair’s practices misled consumers and distorted competition with other airlines.

The Italian authorities ruled that the fee imposed by Ryanair for credit card bookings made by a credit card other than a specified, pre-paid Mastercard was unavoidable.

Ryanair strongly contested the finding claiming it had evidence which showed a third of all reservations made on its Italian website were made with a pre-paid Mastercard.

In its ruling the CJEU reaffirmed EU case law that airlines are obliged to indicate the air fare and separately taxes, charges, surcharges and fees that are unavoidable and foreseeable from the first time the price is indicated online.

The court said airlines were also required to indicate the optional price supplements “in a clear, transparent and unambiguous way only at the start of the booking process.”

The CJEU said the foreseeability of fees for using a credit card other than that approved by Ryanair resulted from the airline’s policy and they were also unavoidable as in reality it meant a free service was “reserved for the benefit of a restricted class of privileged consumers”.

In relation to online check-in fees, the CJEU accepted that where there was at least one option to check-in free of charge, the fees should be regarded as optional and do not necessarily have to be indicated in the initial offer.

Ryanair has a chequered history with the Italian competition and market authority and is also separately challenging a €3 million fine imposed by the watchdog last year over changes to its cabin luggage policy that was introduced in 2018.

The antitrust body claim the imposition of a fee for larger items of cabin luggage up to 10 kilos was increasing ticket prices in a non-transparent manner."

In 1997, the Indian government gave up its power to get any number of its treasury bills bought by the central bank, restricting itself to a temporary overdraft. For financing, it had to go to the bond market.

In 2015, the bank moved to inflation targeting, raising hopes that the rupee would one day be used and held internationally, giving India a durably lower cost of capital. That was then. Now, workers are stranded without jobs or pay. Firms are failing, lenders are piling up bad credit, and state governments are running out of funds. It’s crucial to secure financing for at least 13% of gross domestic product in federal and state deficits. That’s a $342 billion shortfall.

The government is unlikely to lean on the Reserve Bank of India for funding until at least September, the Business Standard reported Tuesday. Yet with foreign investors fleeing emerging markets, pretending that funds could materialize in the bond market is delusional. C. Rangarajan, the RBI governor who signed the 1997 agreement to end back-door monetization of public debt, believes its return may be inevitable.The right way to bring it back is by the front entrance. Stealth operations, like the RBI propping up a sovereign bond auction by asking dealers to buy on its behalf, according to a news report by Cogencis, are pointless subterfuge. It’s time the authority openly bought notes from the government by printing new money.

More than a grand vision, the bold approach needs details, which the middle managers in the Finance Ministry and the RBI need to fill in. For a start, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government should sell stakes in every company that’s on the block for privatization — as well as some that aren’t — to a special purpose vehicle run by, say, the National Investment and Infrastructure Fund Ltd., which has demonstrated fund-raising clout with global investors. The SPV will finance the purchase by issuing sovereign-backed debt. When market conditions improve, it will sell its stakes and redeem the bonds.

Whatever is raised should be deployed in an infrastructure plan that has health at its centerpiece. This will boost construction and create jobs. Subsidized loans should be made available, but only to businesses that keep at least as many people on their payrolls as they had in February and make suppliers’ invoices available on a bill-discounting platform so vendors can get paid. It’s the workers and small and mid-size enterprises that are getting hammered by large companies passing on the pain of dislocation. In some private firms, such as airlines, the government will have to infuse equity.

It’s time to establish credibility with action, and not by observing institutional niceties. Excessive virtue-signaling by Japan serves as a cautionary tale. After its 1980s asset bubble burst, the monetary authority got tangled up in unconventional policies. Yet, the Bank of Japan bound itself to a “bank note rule,” vowing not to own more government bonds than could be repurchased by the private sector with the currency in circulation. It took Governor Haruhiko Kuroda’s April 2013 bazooka to demolish the illusion that the BOJ was providing a temporary shelter for public debt — not swapping it with money forever.

India’s central bank also needs to think beyond cutting interest rates and flooding banks with liquidity. In McKinsey & Co.’s estimates, gross domestic product this year is on track to shrink by 2% to 3%. Deeper declines aren’t ruled out. The jobless rate is estimated to be near 23%. With no risk of inflation except perhaps in some food items, there’s no need to be coy about monetizing deficits. Being smart will do.

243,243,https://nz.news.yahoo.com/trump-organization-written-u-bailout-132008337.html,"Trump Organization, Written Out of U.S. Bailout, Taps Europe Aid","(Bloomberg) -- The Trump Organization is seeking U.K. and Irish bailout money to help cover wages for bartenders, bagpipers and other employees furloughed from its European golf properties because of the coronavirus lockdown.Overseas businesses owned by U.S. President Donald Trump can tap government",nz.news.yahoo.com,"(Bloomberg) -- The Trump Organization is seeking U.K. and Irish bailout money to help cover wages for bartenders, bagpipers and other employees furloughed from its European golf properties because of the coronavirus lockdown.

Overseas businesses owned by U.S. President Donald Trump can tap government funds meant to help retain workers. In the U.S., by contrast, they’re specifically written out of the enormous U.S. economic relief package. The result is a potentially stark gap between how workers in different countries may weather the crisis, even within the same global operation.

In the U.K. and Ireland, where Trump owns three money-losing golf resorts, companies can tap enough government cash to pay most of their workers’ salaries. It’s unclear whether the Trump Organization is paying the balance of the salaries for furloughed workers.

In the U.S., roughly 2,000 employees dismissed from Trump golf courses and hotels will have to line up with millions of others to apply for unemployment payments.

There’s nothing improper about Trump companies seeking the U.K. and Irish funds, which are offered universally to help workers weather the crisis. Even so, social-media blowback has been swift against deep-pocketed owners who could arguably weather the crisis without seeking state handouts. These include Victoria Beckham, the former Spice Girl who reportedly furloughed as many as 30 employees at her money-losing luxury fashion label.

Martin Ford, an elected official in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, where one of the resorts is located, said that a similar standard should be applied to Trump, who’s boasted of his billions.

“The huge tab for this will be borne throughout the whole population through higher taxes,” said Ford, a longtime critic of the Trump resort. “If what he says about his personal wealth is true, Trump doesn’t need the money, and I don’t see why U.K. taxpayers of the future should be helping him out.”

Alan Garten, the Trump Organization’s chief lawyer, didn’t respond to requests for comment. Managers at two of the sites said they had taken measures offered by the government to protect their employees.

Although the Trump family business was explicitly prohibited from benefiting from federal aid authorized in the last few weeks by Congress, its hotel in Washington is seeking separate relief on $3 million of annual rent that it pays to the U.S. General Services Administration for use of a government-owned former post office, the New York Times reported on Tuesday.

Trump’s three resorts in Scotland and Ireland were just gearing up for the golf season before governments ordered businesses to close last month to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Now they’re among the tens of thousands of companies seeking to tap state relief programs. Companies in the U.K. and Ireland can claim the funds to cover furloughed employees as long as they’ve been paying payroll taxes.

“We’ve laid off the vast majority of our staff,” Joe Russell, the managing director of Trump’s Doonbeg resort on Ireland’s west coast, said in an interview. He declined to say how many had been let go or furloughed under the government’s wage subsidy program. “We are ensuring they’re looked after in terms of the government schemes that are available,” he said.

The Irish wage subsidy program, which has been up and running for several weeks, pays companies to cover 70% of furloughed staff’s weekly take-home pay, subject to a cap, as long as they’re kept on the payroll. For the lowest earners, the government will cover as much as 85% starting next month. A separate Irish program allows individuals who’ve lost work because of the pandemic to claim a weekly payment.

The U.K. formally launched a similar program on Monday to cover 80% of workers’ salaries capped at 2,500 pounds ($3,100), receiving applications from more than 140,000 companies on the first day.

Companies in both countries must apply for the funds on behalf of their employees and are encouraged to make up the difference so workers can get their full salaries.

Russell, the manager at Trump Doonbeg, declined to say whether the resort was topping off the government-funded wages. He said that staff numbers vary according to the season but that during peak times the resort employs about 300 people.

The resort was due to open at the end of March, leaving those scheduled to start in limbo until the government stepped in with additional direct payments to support workers nationally affected by the lockdown, said Rita McInerney, a local business owner who lives nearby. McInerney said the resort has about 90 year-round employees, some of whom are continuing to work as part of a skeletal maintenance staff. She said she’d heard from locals that the rest who’ve been let go are using the government wage subsidy program. “If by availing itself of government subsidies it keeps the business employing people here, then of course they should use it,” McInerney said. “The Trump Organization have been very good to local community.” Trump Turnberry in Scotland is applying to tap the U.K. bailout funds for employees, according to Peter Henderson, a local elected official who lives near the resort and has spoken to workers there. Like any company, he said, the resort should take advantage of the relief program. “There’s no one playing the course. They followed the rules and closed up shop,” he said. “Like millions of businesses around the globe, we have been forced by government mandate to temporarily close our hospitality and leisure facilities,” said Sarah Malone, executive vice president of the Trump resort in Aberdeenshire. “We are no different to any other business, including many media companies -- this has nothing to do with Trump and does not benefit the business -- the actions we have taken are solely to protect people and their families who would otherwise be out of work and struggling to survive financially.” She declined to comment on the resort’s use of government funds to cover wages. Trump has invested several million dollars over the past decade to buy and revamp the three resorts in Scotland and Ireland, which have continued to lose money, according to their government disclosures. It’s unclear whether Trump has financed the resorts through bank loans or the Trump Organization’s cash flow.His Aberdeen resort lost more than 1 million pounds in 2018, the last year for which results are available. Trump has provided more than 40 million pounds of interest-free loans to the resort, which has never posted a profit, and employed 77 people, according to 2018 filings. He won approval last year for a 150-million-pound plan to expand the resort by building vacation homes. Trump’s Doonbeg resort in Ireland, which he bought in 2014, lost 1.5 million euros ($1.6 million), in 2018, but revenue increased by 7% to 11.4 million euros, according to filings. His flagship Turnberry resort lost 10.8 million pounds in 2018, the disclosures show. In total, Trump has lent 115 million pounds to Turnberry since he bought the resort in 2014.

Gretchen Whitmer’s stay-at-home order rallied outside the governor’s residence in Lansing on Thursday, waving signs and making speeches about why they want the state economy to reopen.

Videos shared on Facebook by organizers of the rally showed a couple dozen ralliers outside the home.

The protest was announced earlier this week, but was not as well attended as last week’s Operation Gridlock at the Michigan Capitol and in downtown Lansing. Ahead of the rally, Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey, R-Clarklake, spoke out against the protest, saying that while he supports the protesters’ cause, demonstrating outside someone’s home is not helpful.

“There is need now to express our opinions, concerns, and frankly, demands. But there is no need, and never should be, to threaten government leaders to the point of putting their lives at risk. No need. No space,” Shirkey wrote in a social media post. ""So I stand with those protesting, and millions of others who would like to join them, but we cannot allow these protests to translate to personal threats.

“I strongly exhort those organizing the protests to limit the venue to public spaces and around government buildings. Don’t protest at homes. Even the public Governor’s residence. It is indeed public property. But the adjacent properties and neighborhood are not.”

Among the organizers of Thursday’s protest was Rob Cortis, known for his traveling “Trump Unity Bridge.”

During a livestream on his Facebook page, Cortis interviewed a handful of people attending the protest who shared stories of how the order has impacted their lives. Some called for Whitmer to be removed from office while others simply said they just wanted to get back to work.

“They won’t shut us us down,"" said Brandon Hall, an organizer of the demonstration."" ... We’re telling Gretchen Whitmer to open Michigan now and we’re asking her ‘Why the hell don’t you work from home like you’re asking everyone else to?’”

Hall was convicted of election fraud and sentenced to a month in jail in 2018.

Another rally against Michigan’s stay-at-home order on the Capitol lawn is planned for 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. Thursday, April 30.

In addition to washing hands regularly and not touching your face, officials recommend practicing social distancing, assuming anyone may be carrying the virus. Health officials say you should be staying at least 6 feet away from others and working from home, if possible. Carry hand sanitizer with you, and use disinfecting wipes or disinfecting spray cleaners on frequently-touched surfaces in your home (door handles, faucets, countertops) and when you go into places like stores.

‘Short-term extension’ of Michigan’s stay-at-home order likely necessary to limit coronavirus spread, Whitmer says

A COVID-19 analyzer and related equipment are scheduled to arrive in the Falkland Islands over the weekend, which means the prospect of much faster testing of the Islands' swabs for potential virus contagion, and without having to send them to the UK.

However once the machine arrives in the Falklands, there will be a number of days of introduction, machine calibration and training at the Stanley hospital, KEMH, that will be followed by trial tests to ensure accuracy before swabs can begin to be processed locally.

The Falklands' government will update on progress next week.

As to the current pandemic situation, as of Wednesday, no new cases have been reported in the Falklands. So far 337 samples have been tested in the UK with 12 positive cases, all of them staff from Mount Pleasant Complex. No cases have tested positive among Stanley and Camp residents.

FIG reported on Wednesday that eleven of the twelve individuals have completed self isolation or treatment.

Finally KEMH reiterates that if you feel unwell with flu-like symptoms and are worried you might have COVID-19, phone the hospital on 28000. Staff will provide advice but DO NOT GO to the hospital."

The lockdown is not stopping locals around Vihar lake from having picnics in the vicinity. A report in this paper stated that according to sources, they have increased.

The report, buttressed by pictures, show people treating this period as an opportunity for an outing.

A more worrying aspect of the report also says that besides the illegal fishing and picnics, some illegal hutments are being constructed near the lake or and some distance away. Some chunks of land are being barricaded with wooden poles and green cloth and hutments are being made inside.

There is fear that these parts will be completely taken away if action is not taken now. Besides the illegality, it will also upset the ecological balance in the few green spots we have left.

We do hope the authorities investigate these violations amid a lockdown and take action.

More importantly, they must move quickly when it comes to allegations of illegal hutments.

Taking a macro view of this, there is a possibility that open grounds or green spots may see encroachment during this time.

Those who seek to take unfair advantage do know that the hardworking police force is stretched thin these days. It would be entirely possible, in fact, an opportune time to slip under the radar, and usurp a piece of land.

Those who work towards ensuring that Mumbai's few open spaces remain that way will vouch for how difficult it is to remove encroachments once they take root. There is a real danger that given the crisis, this may turn into an open season for encroachers.

But the highlight of the show – undoubtedly – is the photo day hijinks between Anthony Rizzo and Jon Lester. As our friend Corey Freedman points out on Twitter, this gif will forever be a memorable one:

WATCH: Celebs fighting coronavirus and doing weird things in lockdown

British fashion guru Trinny Woodall should have given her partner clothing advice before jumping on a Facebook Live for fans this week, given the 76-year-old art collector popped up in the background wearing nothing at all.

Viewers were shocked when Charles Saatchi wandered into the background – bum bare to all – as TV’s What Not To Wear star gave a beauty tutorial yesterday morning.

Stylist-turned-beauty mogul Woodall, 56, has been entertaining fans with online broadcasts talking about her skin care routine, makeup and clothing while in lockdown in West London.

But on Wednesday, fans got a little more than they bargained for.

The Trinny London founder was in the middle of telling viewers about her favourite Estée Lauder serum and showing off her $780 LED face mask when art collector Charles Saatchi appeared pantsless in the corner of the screen.

Woodall was broadcasting from the bathroom in their West London home.

Viewer Tracy Baker, 42, said: “I’m unsure if she knew he was in camera shot but after he walked past she put her hand up to hide that side of the bathroom.

“She had her mask on so I didn’t see if she was embarrassed or not.”

The video has since been taken down from Trinny’s Facebook page, and when approached by The Sun, she declined to comment.

She and multi-millionaire businessman Charles began dating in 2014.

His 10-year marriage to Nigella Lawson ended in 2013 after he was pictured with his hands around her throat.

Saatchi received a caution for assault following an investigation by police.

Despite the incident making global headlines, Woodall, who was introduced to Saatchi shortly after the split, said she didn’t know anything about it.

Speaking to Stellar magazine last year, she said of the night they first met: “Really weirdly, I still didn’t know any of that sh*t”.

This week’s livestream gaffe isn’t the first time Woodall has shocked fans.

In an interview on The Sunday Project last year, the fashion maven left the panel speechless after dropping the C-bomb on-air.

Speaking of her former What Not to Wear co-host Susannah Constantine, Woodall said the pair were still great friends who always “call each other rude names — like c-u-*-* …”.

The hosts were visibly shocked, and Woodall also appeared mortified, going on to explain she had meant to leave out a few letters.

“I love it, because it nourishes the community, as well as the economy,” said Angela Mills, executive director of LIFT-UP.

Before the COVID-19 pandemic, and the related economic costs of lockdowns, LIFT-UP typically served 625 families per month. Now, they’re serving close to 2,000 at mobile food pantries from Parachute to Carbondale.

The increased demand for food has brought in more funding, which has allowed LIFT-UP to expand an existing Farm to Food Pantry program, sponsored by a LiveWell Colorado grant, designed to help charities source food locally.

“As long as the funding is there, what we’ve been able to do is bring more farmers on board, and purchase more options from them,” Mills said.

One of the existing local suppliers is Potter Farms in Missouri Heights, which supplies ground beef to LIFT-UP. Mills has had to increase orders of the pasture-raised beef in recent weeks to keep up with the need.

“We could go through 1,400 pounds of ground beef a week,” Mills said.

Justina Potter, who runs the cattle ranch and farm operation with her husband, Ted, is grateful for the additional orders.

“We have a school and restaurants that we supply to. The school is shut down, and one restaurant is doing takeout here in Carbondale, but it’s limited so that’s reduced, and the other restaurant is shut down,” Potter said.

As the weather warms for vegetable crops, LIFT-UP will have several local garden cooperatives providing fresh produce.

There are other benefits to sourcing food locally beyond nutrition and supporting nearby farms.

“So many people, I think, tend to think that they go to the grocery store, and it will always be there,” Potter said.

Pandemic shopping has shown that one cannot always count on items being available.

LIFT-UP hasn’t faced supply chain issues with produce or meat, but a few weeks ago cereal was hard to get, Mills said.

“I think that having folks understand how local agriculture and food production is tied to food insecurity is huge, and it’s not a conversation we have a lot,” said Sara Tymczyszyn, director of the fledgling Highwater Farm in Silt.

As a new producer in the Farm to Food Pantry Program, Highwater is gearing up to plant their first crops at the Silt River Preserve. The farm intends to donate 25 percent of their crop to LIFT-UP, and sell the remaining 75 percent.

Sourcing food for nutrition programs locally could avoid harm from disruptions to the broader supply chains.

“I think that’s a benefit because when the bigger operations shut down, they have a place to get products for people in the community,” Potter said.

Even if charities and average consumers get more of their food locally, it can be difficult to predict how much local farmers will need to plant to cover demand later in the season, according to Ben Armstrong of the Farm Collaborative at Cozy Point Ranch in Snowmass, which supplies cabbage to LIFT-UP.

“On the one hand, there’s a lot of demand for local food because people are realizing the bigger supply chains might be at risk. On the other hand, we know that our normal markets are going to be out of whack,” Armstrong said.

“All of us farmers feel very fortunate to still have work during this time. We’re going to keep working as hard as we can to grow a lot of food, and hopefully, there will be some programs to get that into everybody’s hands,” Armstrong added."

During a weekly press conference on COVID-19 broadcast online from Copenhagen, Kluge confirmed that over 1.2 million people had been infected with COVID-19 in the European region, almost 50 percent of the global total, and 110,000 of them had died in the past 100 days.

Kluge also revealed that half of all European COVID-19-related deaths occurred among residents of long-term care facilities. It's an ""unimaginable human tragedy,"" he said.

Kluge stressed that the pandemic had ""shone a spotlight on the overlooked and undervalued corners of our society.""

""The way that such care facilities operate, how residents receive care - is providing pathways for the virus to spread,"" he said.

""We must step up,"" Kluge said, arguing that ""we have a clear investment case for setting up integrated, person-centered long-term care systems in each country.""

To this end, he said that care workers -- ""the unsung heroes of this pandemic"" -- must be empowered by ensuring that they have personal protective equipment (PPE), appropriate remuneration, proper training and ""suitable levels of resources and staffing.""

He stressed an ""immediate and urgent need"" to change the way long-term care facilities operate, and a need to isolate all suspected cases immediately.

According to Kluge, ""quality, resourced, strong and sustainable care systems"" must be built that prioritize people's needs.

""We must bring together physicians, nurses, pharmacists, social and other health care professionals, care workers, and above all, care home residents themselves, in decision-making and care provision,"" said Kluge.

According to Kluge, these measures would not only help curtail the spread of the virus but ultimately allow for the managed opening of locked-down care homes to families and visitors.

""Complacency could be our worst enemy at this time ... Any steps to ease social and physical distancing measures must be carefully considered and gradually undertaken,"" he stressed. Enditem"

Equinor’s decision breaks a long-standing industry taboo. For years, the world’s biggest oil companies have avoided cutting dividends come what may to keep investors sweet and instead raised debt when necessary to maintain spending.

“Equinor has already taken forceful actions to strengthen our liquidity and financial resilience under the current circumstances,” Chief Executive Eldar Saetre said on Thursday.

“In this extraordinary market situation, we have now also decided to reduce the cash dividend for the first quarter 2020 by 67%, compared to the proposed fourth quarter 2019 dividend,” he said in a statement.

Equinor’s first-quarter cash dividend will be $0.09, down from $0.27 in the final quarter of 2020, it said.

Equinor’s shares were down 2.1% at 0842 GMT, underperforming a 1.9% rise in European energy stocks.

Some investors have said major oil companies should consider cutting shareholder payouts rather than taking on more debt given how high their debt-to-capital ratios have become.

Equinor recently announced plans to cut investment, exploration drilling and operating costs by about $3 billion to help weather the coronavirus crisis, which has sent crude prices to their lowest in more than two decades. [O/R]

The company also suspended its $5 billion 2019-2022 share buyback plan last month and raised $5 billion in a bond issue on April 1.

“The purpose of the combined efforts, including a reduction in dividend, is to secure balance sheet capacity, strengthen liquidity and support continued investments in a high-quality project portfolio,” Equinor said.

“This provides for long-term competitive growth and shareholder value.”

Equinor last made outright cuts to its dividend during the financial crisis of 2008-2009. In the years following the 2014 oil price crash, it opted for a so-called scrip dividend, giving investors the option of receiving shares instead of cash.

“The move is one of extreme caution given the extraordinary market conditions rather than an expression of balance sheet weakness or credit rating pressure,” Bernstein analysts wrote in a note to clients, adding that the decision was disappointing.

If the overall macroeconomic situation improves, however, Equinor’s dividend may rise in the third quarter, they said.

The price of North Sea Brent crude hit a 21-year low of $15.98 per barrel on Wednesday, down 75% since the start of the year as demand for oil collapsed due to the outbreak of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus."

Donations should be made in accordance with CDC or similar guidelines and can be dropped off between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. at either Central Fire Station at 451 E. Third St. or West Fire Station at 1077 W. Broadway St.

Both stations will have bins outside that are clearly marked. The Winona Fire Department advises those who arrive in bulk to take turns and practice physical distancing of at least six feet, as no firefighters will be present outside the buildings for monitoring.

All masks will be disinfected and cleaned before they’re distributed.

It is noted on the state’s website that homemade masks do not replace medical-grade protective equipment, but are useful in keeping a wearer’s germs from getting on other people. Homemade masks should tightly enclose the area surrounding the nose and mouth, from the bridge of the nose down to the chin and should cover most of a wearer’s cheeks. Double-layered fabric is preferred, according to the state, and must be machine washable. It is also requested that the masks are able to endure expected amounts of moisture from breathing.

Hundreds of homemade masks have already been donated throughout the community by the fire department with help from the Winona Neighbors Helping Neighbors group."
256,256,https://www.kob.com/national-news/stopping-virus-a-huge-challenge-at-crowded-us-meat-plants/5708300/?cat=649,Stopping virus a huge challenge at crowded US meat plants,,www.kob.com,"The list of companies dealing with infected workers has been growing every day at plants across the country. Among the latest was the closure Wednesday of Tyson Foods' huge pork-processing plant in Waterloo, Iowa, after numerous workers tested positive. That follows closures of a Smithfield Foods pork plant in Sioux Falls, South Dakota; a JBS beef plant in Greeley, Colorado; and many others. Some, including the Tyson pork plant in Perry, Iowa, have reopened after deep cleanings.

The closures shouldn't cause any immediate meat shortages or big price jumps at supermarkets, but as Purdue University economist Jason Lusk noted, ""It's a very fluid and volatile situation to keep an eye out for in the days to come.""

Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds, whose state leads the nation in pork production, acknowledged the likelihood of ""clusters of positive cases"" at meat-processing plants but said the operations must remain open.

""Without them, people's lives and our food supply will be impacted,"" Reynolds said.

At least 10 worker deaths linked to the virus have been reported at meat-processing plants nationwide, according to the United Food and Commercial Workers union.

In an attempt to protect workers, companies have started checking employee temperatures, staggering breaks and altering start times. Owners said they have also done more to clean plants, added more break space, slowed production lines so workers can spread out and added plastic shields between workstations.

""We are looking for countless ways of ensuring we have good, healthy social distancing in our plants. It's not impossible despite the number of people in our plants,"" said Hector Gonzalez, Tyson's senior vice president of human resources.

Major companies, including Smithfield, Tyson, Cargill and JBS, said they have relaxed their attendance and sick leave policies to encourage sick workers to stay home and allow them to be paid.

Still, workplace safety expert Celeste Monforton said it's difficult to ensure people working so closely together won't spread the virus.

""The scary thing is you know if it could happen in one plant, the potential is there for a lot of other plants,"" said Monforton, a lecturer in public health at Texas State University. ""Unless you're super vigilant, this is a recipe for disaster.""

Even companies with the best intention may struggle because plant layouts make 6-foot distancing difficult, said Jim Roth, director of the Center for Food Security and Public Health at Iowa State University. Precautions such as face masks and plastic shields can help but likely won't eliminate the risk, he said. Some plants can spread workers out by slowing down operations, but that's not possible everywhere and would reduce a plant's capacity.

""They were constructed to have people stand next to each other and work, and that's very difficult to change,"" Roth said.

Edgar Fields, president of the Southeast Council of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, which represents thousands of poultry workers, said it's hard to know if the precautions will protect workers.

""We say 6 feet �?� but what is enough?"" Fields asked. ""What else is it that we can ask them to do to try to protect their employees when they walk in the door and when they walk out. I don't know. All of this is new.""

Alejandra Wehunt, 22, of Gainesville, Georgia, said she stopped going to work at a poultry processing plant after a coworker tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.

""I have a young daughter. I live with my grandmother. I have seizures and heart problems. I can't catch anything,"" said Wehunt. ""If one person got it, probably many others have it too.""

Wehunt said the plant manager at the Gold Creek Foods plant had told workers that they had to show up to work or risked losing their jobs, despite the pandemic.

""Why are we losing our jobs because we don't want to put our health in jeopardy,"" she said.

Joshua Specht, a University of Notre Dame history professor who has studied the meat industry, said it relies on workers at the margins of society - including recent immigrants - who don't have a safety net and therefore feel pressure to continue working even if they are ill.

""With workers in close proximity, working long hours, and feeling pressure to continue even when sick, the meat industry is at particular risk for pandemic-related disruptions,"" Specht said.

St Mary’s in Dunmow officially opened its brand new library on Monday morning and welcomed children’s laureate Anthony Brown to cut the ribbon.

Headteacher Val White said: “Thanks to the generosity the library is equipped with new bookshelves, computers, sofas, comfortable chairs, floor cushions and rugs to make it an appealing place for reading, researching and above all for enjoying books.

“Our old library was so full of books there was barely room to stand. Now we have space for children to sit and read on a sofa or armchair, or lie on the rug or cushions.

“Many children choose to read in the library during their playtimes and bring their parents in after school to choose books together.

“Because so many aspects of learning depend upon the ability to read, we know that our new library and collection of books will be of lasting benefit to all our children.”

The opening was attended by representatives from the school PTA who have organised and helped with fund raising activities for the last two years.

Parents of the school also contributed £12,000 to the project.

Mr Browne was shown around the library by a group of very enthusiastic children and he gave a talk to two large groups about stories and illustrations.

Throughout the week pupils have also been having book themed assemblies and mealtimes and competitions.

Whether healthy or not, the coronavirus can kill you, and do it quickly. Patients who cannot breathe on their own are put on ventilators; some recover but a very high percentage in such critical condition die.

Doctors in New York City, Spain, Italy and elsewhere feared that they would not have enough ventilators for the number of patients who needed them. Health care providers will do everything possible to save you, unless you have an order or directive that tells them you do not want them to go to those lengths.

In an article in this newspaper about Planning for the Future during COVID-19, several types of “advance directives” were discussed. These are ways that each of us can communicate our wishes and beliefs about future medical care, and how far we want doctors to go in trying to keep us alive.

Such important decisions must be in writing, stating your specific wishes about medical care, as in a “living will” or a MOLST form, or delegating that decision-making to another person through a “health care proxy.”

All three of these documents are designed to tell others what you prefer for life-prolonging and other end-of-life care.

Most of us want to avoid thinking about this. But if we don’t decide for ourselves, someone else will have to make our decisions.

That might be a relative or friend named in our living will or health care proxy. Or, if we didn’t sign one of those, then a spouse, sibling or other family member must struggle to decide.

Why put the burden and responsibility on someone else? Let those who care about you know your wishes.

A “living will” expresses what we want to happen if we are no longer able able to make decisions or tell people our wishes. If you have particular preferences about whether or not you want to be provided life-sustaining procedures, then it is important to put that in writing so others will know and honor them.

Since we cannot anticipate all situations where medical decisions may need to be made for us, it is best to also sign a “health care proxy” naming who has that authority. Many people do both documents.

In the article, Dr. Russell Hartung commented that the most important form from the emergency department point-of-view is called “Medical Orders for Life Sustaining Treatment” or MOLST. The form is available online at the NY Department of Health website at: tinyurl.com/sdj55ea, where you will also find FAQ.

A key difference between this and the other “advance directives” is that you go over this with your doctor or nurse practitioner, and that person signs it. The New York State Health Department says that the process begins with one or more conversations between the patient and their health care provider to cover the “patient´s goals for care,” review possible treatment options . . . and ensure shared, informed medical decision–making.”

The signed form becomes an actual medical order, and must be followed by all health care professionals who treat you, unless it is later changed by a physician or nurse practitioner after examining you.

People with serious health conditions, particularly those who are likely to die within a year and/or are in long-term care facilities will find the MOLST form most relevant. In this current pandemic, even healthy people are dying, so thinking ahead to whether or not you want life-sustaining treatment makes sense.

The MOLST form is structured for you to make separate decisions about whether or not you want: (1) CPR to restart your heart if you have no pulse or are not breathing, (2) any limitation on medical interventions, (3) “intubation and long-term mechanical ventilation,” (4) artificially administered fluids and nutrition, (5) antibiotics. Stopping a treatment that is not helpful is also possible. It allows you to choose “comfort measures only” to relieve pain and suffering.

Many people know what they want, but have not put that down on paper. Now is a good time to do it.

Two warm winters in a row in addition to the health crisis have gutted demand for the fuel used for everything from home heating to power generation. That’s left inventories brimming during a season when they’re usually drained.

A decade ago, the industry was still developing. That kept hefty premiums for shipping liquefied natural gas (LNG) by tanker to places such as Asia far from pipeline networks. These days, LNG has grown into a global industry allowing gas to flow freely around the world. That and the demand slump is gutting the margins on once-lucrative shipping routes.

“I joined LNG when there was a $3 dollar margin” on every million British thermal unit of gas shipped, Sarah Behbehani, a senior vice-president of LNG at Jera Global Markets who has two decades of experience in energy trading, said in February when she predicted the worst year ever for the fuel. “Now we scramble for 2c.”

As recently as two years ago, traders could depend on gas prices of $4 in the US, $8 in Europe and $11 in Japan and South Korea. Today there’s less than 25c difference between the rates in those regions.

That’s a far cry from the boom years for traders in 2011. When an earthquake in Japan caused the worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl, that nation shut down its reactors and scrambled for gas to keep the lights on. Royal Dutch Shell diverted nine ships full of LNG, each worth tens of millions of dollars, from Brunei, Russia and Nigeria to Japan.

That episode sent fuel prices and shipping rates higher, underscoring the competition for prized LNG cargoes and helping foster a global trading network. After years of investment in ports to handle the fuel which is chilled to -162°C, LNG has become the fastest-growing energy commodity.

Margins to ship the fuel have been narrowing for almost a year, starting with an unusually warm winter in Europe and Asia in 2019 that cut the need for fuel during the heating season. The Covid-19 pandemic drew more life out of the market, causing storage tanks to fill well beyond seasonal norms.

With no end in sight to those trends, margins narrowed, reducing the incentive for US exporters to send gas to Asia. Atlantic cargoes are staying in the Atlantic and the same is happening in the Pacific basin, according to brokerage Tullett Prebon Energy (Singapore).

Traders have to be quick to make money. Instead of months where an arbitrage would open between regions, the incentive to ship appears rarely for a week or so.

In March, Asian rates rose briefly as European nations halted activity because of the health scare. Cargoes started flowing from the Atlantic to the Pacific, but only until India imposed its own lockdown, which sent Asian prices to fresh lows. Today, there’s little incentive to ship LNG, and traders are watching for signs that buyers will cancel cargoes they have pledged to order.

“The arb is closed,” said Tobias Davis, head of Asia LNG at Tullett Prebon. “We are in a unique trading environment.”

The growth of the global trade also complicated the LNG business, favouring sophisticated traders and the biggest companies with the most clout. No longer is the business dominated by long-term contracts arranged between gas producers and consumers.

Now, a growing array of intermediaries and contract terms allow traders to swap cargoes with each other, divert shipments or even take longer routes to optimise returns. And as vessels become more efficient, they can act as long-term storage facilities holding cargoes until prices improve.

“The market is really developing and the tools are more readily available,” Peter Abdo, MD and head of global origination and LNG at Uniper’s trading unit, said at the Bloomberg Commodity Investor Forum late in 2019.

Here’s what LNG traders can do when the Atlantic-Pacific arbitrage window is closed:

LNG traders engineer swaps when both benefit from using the other’s cargo, usually because of location. For instance, someone with a shipment in Europe but a buyer in Asia could switch with a trader in the opposite situation, thereby saving on transport costs. Swaps can also be done in time, not just location.

Traders such as Gunvor, which is set to receive a new LNG vessel that loses less of its cargo per journey, can benefit from so-called floating storage. That’s a strategy when price signals indicate it’s better to let the cargo sit on board until the approaching heating season boosts prices. Securing a vessel now when rates are relatively low helps.

LNG shipping costs are falling on weaker commodity markets and a lack of arbitrage, according to the Spark30 Atlantic June index compiled by Spark Commodities in Singapore, which takes assessments from LNG shipbrokers. Both May and July contracts also fell on the back of depressed demand, said Tim Mendelssohn, Spark’s MD in Singapore.

Traders can take advantage of lower shipping costs and move cargoes, for example, from the US to northern Asia via a longer route via the Cape of Good Hope, avoiding fees transiting the Panama Canal. Such a longer journey can take a month or more and could mean prices are higher on arrival. It’s not unknown for vessels to take as long as two months in longer routes.

One consequence of the closed Atlantic-Pacific arbitrage is that cargoes from the Yamal LNG project in the Russian Arctic are remaining in northwest Europe, with ships transferring their loads in Belgium or off northern Norway.

While such intraregional saturation can push prices lower, it can also bolster the development of small-scale deliveries deeper into downstream markets, for example as a cleaner fuel for use in transport, said Andrei Belyi, the owner of energy consultancy firm Balesene OU.

“In the context of oversupply we observe an increasing dynamic of small-scale deliveries within each region, which creates a basis for regional LNG markets and small scale deliveries,” said Belyi, who is also an adjunct professor at the University of Eastern Finland."

Honor the Earth is a Native-led organization, established by Winona LaDuke and Indigo Girls Amy Ray and Emily Saliers, in 1993 to address the two primary needs of the Native environmental movement: the need to break the geographic and political isolation of Native communities and the need to increase financial resources for organizing and change. Honor the Earth works to a) raise public awareness and b) raise and direct funds to grassroots Native environmental groups. It is the only Native organization that provides both financial support and organizing support to Native environmental initiatives.

I am speaking, of course, of the protests now taking place in a number of states pushing from the immediate relaxation of COVID-19 pandemic-related countermeasures. In presenting a false choice between health and economic prosperity, the protesters are putting both at risk. In an exercise of supreme selfishness, the protesters have justified their actions as a demonstration in support of freedom and against “tyranny”. I’m sure that the virus agrees.

This is a public health crisis that has caused an economic one. Opening up the nation to business before the pandemic has passed is putting the cart before the horse. The economy will never return if the workforce is sick or dead. Deal with the virus first and the economy, which was relatively healthy pre-pandemic, will soon recover albeit more slowly.

So now we have to trust the health professionals and ourselves in following their fact-based science directives to get us clear of this crisis. In doing so, we have a far better chance of avoiding a catastrophic second or even third wave in the near future. Wishful thinking and specious appeals to freedom won’t do it. The response needs to be both science-based and data driven.

What the scientists are telling us now is that three further actions are now needed to open up our nation. These include universal testing, contact tracing and supported isolation/quarantine, or T.T.SI. None are yet at the level needed to relax current mitigation measures. Key will be oversight provided by a fully engaged and focused federal government. The intent is to make sure that the coast is so clear that we can reopen to stay open for good and not fall into a vicious “open-close-open” cycle driven by the infection’s periodic “on again-off again” resurgence. For a cautionary lesson, one needs to only look at the experience of Toronto, Canada in 2003 with SARs as the premature lifting of mitigation measures led to a resurgence of the virus and, unsurprisingly, more deaths.

With the advent of social media and universal access to the web, everyone has become an expert on literally everything and anything simply because “they heard about it on Facebook” or “I read it online.” Never mind that the source may be simply validating someone’s prejudices, paranoia’s or biases without having been properly cross-referenced or vetted. By thinking that we know so much when we really know so little, we risk becoming detached from reality, prone to making bad decisions and, ultimately, leading others astray. It’s not surprising then that people who think that they know so much easily dismiss experts, expertise and facts. The protests are yet another manifestation that many Americans are manifestly unable to be governed due to their inability to discern fact from fiction.

Enter the Dunning-Kruger Effect. The Dunning-Kruger Effect describes a cognitive bias that enables people of low ability and middling talent to overestimate their abilities.

Social psychologists David Dunning and Justin Kruger described it as “a cognitive bias of illusory superiority that occurs when people overestimate their talents and abilities”. Without some measure of self-awareness a person cannot objectively evaluate their competence or incompetence. It is the difference between Albert Einstein who said that “the more I learn, the more I realize how much I don’t know” on one end and the smug assertion that “I am every stable genius” on the other. The first quote demonstrates humility, grace and wisdom while the latter is delusional and a wonderful example of the Dunning-Kruger Effect.

When we have leaders that egg on supporters to believe that they know everything and don’t want to be confused by the facts, we are at a disadvantage with respect to solving this crisis - any crisis. Trusting in facts and the factfinders not only allows us to solve difficult problems in a logical and rational manner but it also saves lives.

Fowers bloom and crops begin to grow. The farmers are busy as they till the land and loosen the soil, as they nourish it with water and make it grow in time for the good weather.

Eun Sub often remembers Hae Won at any time of the day. He wonders how she takes her day in Seoul. He has not received any call or message of Hae Won's life after she left Hyecheon. He makes himself busy by selling books and stays up late at night.

Life has been a routine and lonely for Hae Won back in Seoul. She returns to audition again for musical events as a cellist. Her face shows a cold heart that brings her foot back to where she was before.

Yoon Taek successfully published Myung Yeo's novel and made a big hit to the public. Myung Yeo plans to leave Hyecheon and is busy preparing her things. She encouraged Myung Joo to write a letter to her daughter and check how she's been. In many attempts, Myung Joo was able to complete her message to Hae Won.

Myung Joo shared her thoughts about being a cold-hearted mother. At a young age, she got pregnant and took care of her, and things moved fast. Myung Joo suffered a great deal from her abusive husband. She asked forgiveness from Hae Won and expressed that her love remains the same as her mother. Myung Joo requested her daughter to return to Hodu house and send her Auntie off before she leaves. The weather was fine, and it was good to have her back in Hyecheon city.

Jang Woo and Eun Sil finally expressed their feelings for each other. They are officially a couple and hope to get married.

Hae Won bought a coffee in a shop and met Young Woo. They chatted for a while and agreed to remain friends. On the other hand, Eun Sub met his friends back in high school with Jang Woo. They looked for Hae Won and wished to see her the next meet up.

On a fine day, Myung Yeo was surprised to see Hae Won at their front door. She's back in Hodu house, and no one knew about it. The sisters and Hae Won took their lunch in the city. Hae Won shared that she wishes to open a music school for young children. She realized that life had been hard in Seoul, and she felt the warmth in Hyecheon and wished to feel it again.

Myung Joo sold the house in Paju and will stay in Hodu house from now on. Yoon Taek came and picked up Myung Yeo at her destination. He asked Myung Yeo if she's coming back. She thought and replied there's no reason to go back for now.

Hae Won went to the book store and saw Eun Sub is about to leave to visit his biological mother for her death anniversary. She nodded as the car took off, seeing Eun Sub face with a cold smile. Eun Sub looks at the side mirror and sees Hae Won running after his car. He hits the brake and steps outside to check on Hae Won. Hae Won asked to hug him and hold him tight. She missed Eun Sub as she could remember it's been a while. Eun Sub looks at her, and slowly, his eyes sparkled.

The weather is fine. Spring brought a new life to Hyecheon city. Flowers bloom, and foods are cooked for the season.

Hae Won reads a book she finds that fits her life with Eun Sub. A life of happiness she believes that will come when she endures life with him.

""A Piece of Your Heart Kept Until The End""

""Happiness is hard to notice and even if you do, it takes a lot of effort and care to make it yours. We all strive to be happy. Happiness is hard to get hold of and does not stay with you for a long time. Even if you work hard for a long time, you might fail to be happy. But, no one can predict our future. If we keep moving forward endlessly if we keep trying if we keep our lives. I believe that day will come"". 

""That's what happiness is like. It's a difficult thing. But even when you do open your eyes in the morning to begin your day. And quietly live your life today, you may be achieving that difficult thing. And making someone happy at this moment. To some, you are maybe someone to be thankful for, you may not realize it. But just by living like this, you should know you have lived a life"" - The Weather is Fine."

First-quarter revenue got a nearly $250 million boost from stockpiling of Lilly’s insulin products, Trulicity and psoriasis drug Taltz. However, this benefit would largely be reversed over the course of 2020, the company said.

Lilly raised the top end of its full-year adjusted profit forecast by 10 cents, citing increased demand for its newer drugs, and now expects to earn $6.70 to $6.90 per share.

It said it expects clinical trials delayed by the pandemic to resume in the second half of the year.

The company also noted that staggeringly high U.S. unemployment rates could force more Americans to shift from commercial health insurance to federal programs or become uninsured. Some 26.5 million Americans have sought unemployment benefits over the last five weeks as efforts to curb the spread of the virus shuttered businesses and schools across the country.

As patients shift to Medicaid - the federal and states-run plan for low-income individuals - Lilly could see lower payments for its drugs, Chief Executive Officer David Ricks told Reuters, adding that the hit would be more pronounced in 2021.

The company said 10% of its customers were on Medicaid, while 40% were commercially insured.

Long-term unemployment rates would lower Medicaid reimbursement for Lilly’s key drugs, said Citi analyst Andrew Baum, adding that there are cheaper alternatives to Trulicity and Taltz.

“We’re looking at everything we can do to ensure that people can stay on our medications and have access to them, and believe that some of these impacts will be temporary,” Chief Financial Officer Joshua Smiley said.

Earlier this month, Lilly capped out-of-pocket costs for insulin products, including widely-used Humalog, at $35 per month.

Lilly is also working on potential treatments for the coronavirus. It has begun testing its new rheumatoid arthritis drug Olumiant for COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus. It is also conducting trials on an experimental biotech drug in pneumonia patients, among other efforts. The virus attacks the lungs and causes pneumonia in severe cases.

Trulicity sales jumped 40% to $1.23 billion, helping drive a 15% rise in total quarterly revenue to $5.86 billion. That topped Wall Street estimates of $5.51 billion.

Excluding items, Lilly earned $1.75 per share, beating analysts’ average estimates by 27 cents, according to Refinitiv data.

Eli Lilly shares were up 2% at $159.84."

This could potentially help save Rs. 50 billion when compared to a similar motorway scheme under CPEC.

The Ministry of Planning and Development stated that the 306-km long project was recommended by the Central Development Working Party (CDWP) to the Executive Committee of National Economic Council (Ecnec) for carrying it out under the public-private partnership (PPP) mode.

The per-kilometer cost of construction for the six-lane motorway is Rs. 596.4 million as compared to the Rs. 760 million if it was built under CPEC as per the Ministry of Planning. The Sukkur-Multan stretch was built between China and Pakistan under a government-to-government agreement and when compared with each other, the per-kilometer cost for Sukkur-Hyderabad is Rs. 164 million or 21.5% lower.

Under CPEC rates, the project would have cost Rs. 232 billion. It will now be presented for approval before the Public-Private Partnership Authority. After the PPP Authority approves it, tenders for competitive bidding will be floated by the National Highway Authority (NHA).

Due to the cross-subsidization of the toll fee for the Multan-Sukkur motorway, this project was presented to CDWP for approval. It has been evaluated under multiple PPP mode where the contractor will construct the project on build, operate and transfer mode, known as BOT."

RIL, with an outstanding debt of ₹3,06,851 crore ($43 billion) is banking on a few more multi-billion-dollar deals in energy, telecom and retail sectors to become a zero-net-debt company by the end of this fiscal.

The proceeds from the Jio-Facebook deal will reduce the net consolidated borrowings of RIL and reinforce the company’s commitment to reduce its net borrowings to zero by March 31, 2021, which is seen as credit positive by analysts.

Moody’s Investor Services expects the Jio-Facebook transaction to reduce RIL’s consolidated net debt/EBITDA by 0.4x to well below 3.0x — the tolerance level for its Baa2 rating. “The investment by Facebook establishes a valuation for RIL’s digital services business and can be used as a base for further divestment by the company. This also increases RIL’s financial flexibility,” Moody’s said. In July 2019, RIL announced the sale of its telecom tower business to Brookfield Asset Management Inc. for ₹25,200 crore.

The company also signed a non-binding letter of intent to sell 20% stake in its oil-to-chemical business to Saudi Aramco for an enterprise value of $15 billion. The company has also entered into a deal with BP Plc to sell 49% stake in its fuel marketing business in India for $1 billion. Together, the proceeds from these transactions will result in a $16 billion reduction in RIL’s net debt and the company’s leverage.

As on December 31, 2019, the company had cash and cash equivalents were at ₹153,719 crore ($21.5 billion)."

Nuta ordered the release of suspect, Junior Flomo and seven others on April 13, court records show.",allafrica.com,"Gbarnga — A 39-year-old man who was charged with raping his grandmother, mother and a one-month-old baby and her mother was among eight pre-trial detainees released by Judge Karboi Nuta, who was assigned to Bong County's Ninth Judicial Circuit Court in February. Nuta ordered the release of suspect, Junior Flomo and seven others on April 13, court records show.

Junior Flomo of Gold Camp in Kokoyah District was arrested in January 2019 after police said he raped his 63-year-old grandmother, his mother, and the infant and her mother in December 2018.

The seven remaining suspects who were charged with statutory rape in separate cases are: Sirleaf Page, Jerome Seawarkpala, Pewee Kerkulah, Konah Daniels, Titus Mulbah, Varney Momo and Emmanuel Togbah. They were accused of raping minors.

Court documents show that Nuta and Bong County Deputy Sheriff Perry Kaneh ordered the suspects' release. The suspects had been in jail for over a year.

When asked his reason for releasing the suspects, Nuta referred our reporter to court clerk only identified as Daniel. Daniel refused to comment on grounds that he was not authorized.

The court released the suspects to Defense Attorney Mohammed Golafaley. Golafaley said the state failed to provide sufficient evidence against the suspects, so the court had the right to release them.

The eight were among 12 suspects that were released on April 13, 2020 because the state failed to provide evidence. The four remaining suspects are: Amos Kollie (charged with illegal possession of firearm); Hajah Togbah and Shadrach Mulbah (both charged with theft of property); and Nancy Gehdeay and Abraham Cooper (charged with aggravated assault. The four suspects were released on bail.

Bong County's Chief Prosecutor Attorney Jonathan N. Flomo said the release of the suspects is a violation of Liberia's Criminal Procedure Law.

He said he is not opposed to the suspects' release, but the court should follow the law.

Under the law, there are two instances where criminal defendants can be released without trial: Chapter 18, Section 18.1 (Dismissal by Prosecuting Attorney) and Section 18.2 (Dismissal by Court for Failure to Proceed).

Section 18.2 of the law says that the state must be given the opportunity to show 'good cause' why the defendant/s should not be released. In the case of the suspects, the state did not receive a motion for ""failure to proceed"" filed by the defense or a motion from the court through a notice that the case had been assigned for hearing, Attorney Flomo said.

Flomo said he received the release document on March 26, 2020 from the sheriff's office for the release of the 12 pre-trial detainees who had been indicted. When he received the notice, Flomo said he met with Judge Nuta and Golafaley and appealed to them not to release the suspects.

He reminded them that Sexual Offenses Division of the Ninth Judicial Circuit Court was created to deal with sexual offenses. Judge George Katapka was appointed, confirmed and commissioned as the presiding judge on March 10, 2020.

According to Chapter 25, Section 25.3 of the amended judicial law, all sexual offenses should be heard in the Sexual Offenses Division of the Ninth Circuit Court of Bong County, not the circuit court.

State prosecutors informed Judge Nuta that several defendants who were released had agreed to confess in court in a plea bargain deal. Junior Flomo was one of those suspects, the prosecutor said.

Despite his plea to Judge Nuta, Attorney Flomo said he was surprised when he learned on April 14, 2020, that the eight suspects who had been indicted on rape, a nonbailable offense under the law, had been released.

Attorney Flomo said he will refer the case to Solicitor General Cllr. Seyma Serena Cephus. Judge Katakpa said Judge Nuta ordered the suspects released before he took office March 10, 2020.

Attorney Flomo said he thought Judge Nuta considered his appeal to not release the suspects. The prosecutor said he was surprised to learn that the eight suspects who were indicted on rape charges, a nonbailable offense, were released.

FPA made further inquiry with the Resident Judge of the Sexual Offenses Division of the Ninth Judicial Circuit for Bong County, His Honor George C. Katakpa who admitted of knowing about the incident but said that he had not assumed office when the action was taken by Judge Nuta.

It can be recalled that His Honor George C. Katapa was appointed by the President of the Republic of Liberia as Resident Judge of the Sexual Offenses Division for the Ninth Judicial Circuit for Bong County and was subsequently confirmed by the Senate and Commissioned. On March 26, 2020, the ""Program Marking the Seating of His Honor George C. Katakpah, Resident Judge, Sexual Offenses Division Criminal Court 'E', 9th Judicial Circuit, Bong County"" was held at the Supreme Court. Thus His Honor George Katakpa's statement seem to contradict that he hadn't assumed office when the action was taken by His Honor Karboi K. Nuta on April 13, 2020."

""What raises concern is especially the fact that Russia acts in the capacity of a co-chair of the OSCE Minsk Group and is an influential country from the political viewpoint. Even if the Armenian side denies that, a statement of the kind by a co-chairing country does give ground to concern,"" he told Tert.am on Wednesday.

Kandaharian said he regrets that over the past years since the April 2016 hostilities, the Armenian authorities never moved to negotiate a plan for reinstating the ceasefire agreed with Russia back then.

""Armenia has to discuss Artsakh's security issue, which was in essence disrupted because of the April War. And the authorities of Artsakh must by all means join these negotiations,"" he said, emphasizing the major focus on security guarantees as the only pivotal factor.

Asked whether the current state of affairs in the Armenian-Russian relations can potentially affect the entire process, Kandaharian admitted that the two issues may be in a way interrelated."

 A few key points:

 

 1) This is mostly pre-crisis data. Existing home sales are counted at the close of escrow, so this report is mostly for contracts signed in January and February. Sales will decline sharply in April and May.

 

 2) Existing home sales were up 0.8% year-over-year (YoY) in March.

 

 2) Inventory is very low, and was down 10.2% year-over-year (YoY) in March. Inventory will probably stay low as people wait to list their homes - and do not want strangers in their house. This is the lowest level of inventory for March since at least the early 1990s.

 

 Click on graph for larger image.

 

 Signed contracts will probably be down sharply year-over-year in April and May.

 

 Note that existing home sales picked up somewhat in the second half of 2019 as interest rates declined.

 

 The second graph shows existing home sales Not Seasonally Adjusted (NSA) by month (Red dashes are 2020), and the minimum and maximum for 2005 through 2019.

Free Markets. Federalism.,www.alec.org,"In their Florida Daily op-ed, ALEC Executive Vice President of Policy and Chief Economist Jonathan Williams and Legislative Manager Skip Estes explain why a personal income tax in Florida would not save the state from a fiscal crisis.

Income tax proponents find themselves in the awkward position of highlighting a very real problem facing state revenue collections, while offering a solution that will make the problem worse.

They are correct revenue volatility during a crisis creates serious fiscal problems; however, enacting an income tax will only increase revenue volatility. Worse yet, enacting an income tax would undoubtedly hurt economic growth in Florida.

When the COVID pandemic clears and Americans go back to work, job creators will resume looking for ways to grow their businesses and save money on taxes. Florida ensures it is best positioned for the post-COVID economy by resisting calls to raise taxes and maintaining its reputation as a pro-growth, low-tax state that avoids a personal income tax."
273,273,http://dbsjeyaraj.com/dbsj/archives/68566,Multi-party Memorandum of Understanding:Sri Lanka Facing a Unique Constitutional Dilemma Caused by a Unique Pandemic Emergency Requires A Unique Solution Outside the Path of Conventional Politics.,,dbsjeyaraj.com,"Once in a lifetime, a country faces a crisis so unique that the ordinary rules of politics should not apply. We expect politicians – political animals by nature – to act in ways that are antithetical to their interests. The COVID-19 pandemic is such a crisis, and Sri Lanka’s politicians have a choice: to opportunistically maximise political gains, or to selflessly put country before politics.

Sri Lanka’s elected President Gotabaya Rajapaksa has a serious dilemma. On the one hand, his mandate is to achieve results. Yet his Government only has a minority share of the seats in Parliament.

The current Government cannot perpetually function on a limited budget. The Constitution clearly vests power over public finance in Parliament. Therefore, the Executive branch headed by the President would need a Legislature to authorise a new budget.

It seems politically acceptable for a president heading a minority government to call an election at the earliest given opportunity to form a stable government. President Rajapaksa has opted for this route, and many other politicians in his place would have done the same.

On the other hand, as the elected representative of the people, President Rajapaksa is bound by the provisions of Sri Lanka’s Constitution. His actions must always comply with the law.

The Constitution – the supreme law of Sri Lanka – provides that when the president dissolves Parliament to call for an early election, he ‘shall summon the new Parliament’ to sit on a date no later than three months since the dissolution of Parliament. That date is 2 June. The deadline is non-negotiable – as long as Parliament continues to be dissolved.

The Election Commission has now set a date for the election: 20 June. The Commission has decided to postpone elections on the basis of an ‘emergency’, when no emergency has been officially declared. This decision further complicates matters, as Parliament cannot stand dissolved if an election is scheduled for a date after 2 June.

In any event, can an election be held in the near future without exposing the people to a public health risk?

President Rajapaksa must now balance his political need to secure a stable government with the legal imperative to comply with the Constitution.

Sri Lanka’s current law is poorly equipped to deal with many aspects of the COVID-19 crisis. For example, the Public Security Ordinance (PSO) only permits the President to impose curfew for the limited purpose of maintaining ‘public order’ in any area. The concept of public order refers to maintaining law and order, and preventing acts of violence and unrest.

This concept is entirely distinct from the concept of public health, which involves the prevention and containment of diseases and other health hazards. In fact, the Sri Lankan Constitution, in article 15, very clearly differentiates between these two concepts. Public order cannot be equated with public health.

There is no other law in Sri Lanka that authorises the Government to impose curfew. For example, neither the Disaster Management Act, nor the Quarantine and Prevention of Diseases Ordinance – both of which deal with public health crises – contemplate the kind of measures that the current Government has imposed in the interests of public health. Since the PSO only deals with a public order crisis, the Government is in dire need to enact new legislation to cope with a unique public health emergency.

Meanwhile, the emergency situation has given rise to a number of new and unprecedented practical challenges. For example, certain institutions, including courts, need to function remotely; certain essential services, including the processing of official documentation, need to be provided digitally; special assistance needs to be provided to the destitute, including daily wage earners who have lost incomes; ports, transport services, and educational institutions need to be regulated; high value industries that employ large numbers of people and earn much needed foreign exchange must be protected from closure. The current law is completely inadequate to deal with these myriad challenges.

Many democracies around the world have responded to this crisis by enacting vital new laws. Yet, in Sri Lanka, the only institution empowered to frame new laws is no longer functioning.

We return to President Rajapaksa’s dilemma. He needs a Legislature to authorise new budgetary allocations, and to enact new legislation to deal with a plethora of challenges. He does not want to reconvene a Parliament in which his Government lacks a majority. However, he cannot easily call an election either, as an unprecedented health crisis continues to threaten the country. His position is unenviable. Yet the only solution available to him may lie outside the realm of ordinary politics.

The framers of Sri Lanka’s Constitution had foresight when they decided to include article 70(7) in the Constitution. This provision permits a president to summon Parliament, even when it has been dissolved, if the president is ‘satisfied that an emergency has arisen’. If Parliament reconvenes due to this special summoning by the president, it will be entirely temporary, and Parliament would stand dissolved the moment the emergency ends. There are very good reasons President Rajapaksa should employ this provision to deal with the crisis.

The COVID-19 crisis is undoubtedly an emergency. The President does not need to rely on the PSO to satisfy himself that Sri Lanka is in a state of emergency, as the PSO only deals with public order emergencies. He can simply declare an emergency in a proclamation issued under article 70(7) of the Constitution.

If he wishes to rely on some legal guidance, he need not look further than Sri Lanka’s Disaster Management Act, which recognises that an ‘epidemic’ constitutes a ‘disaster’. The Act permits the President to declare a ‘state of disaster’. Even if the President opts out of such a declaration, he would surely see the sense in recognising the current crisis as an ‘emergency’ in order to issue a proclamation under article 70(7).

How can the President ensure that Parliament, when temporarily reconvened, would act in the public interest and not out of political interest?

It may be necessary for all parties to put aside their political agendas and support the President in a clear legislative plan to deal with this crisis. In fact, some Opposition parliamentarians have already come forward and pledged to support the Government if Parliament is reconvened.

A multi-party memorandum of understanding ought to be framed to agree on this special plan. The Legislature and Executive must then come together to frame and enforce a new law that meets all aspects of the crisis. The law must give some flexibility to the Executive to make decisive decisions without unnecessary red tape. It must also institute checks and balances, including legislative oversight and judicial review of decisions.

The President ought to take this gamble for two reasons. First, it is simply the right thing to do in a crisis of this magnitude. No government should be left to deal with such a crisis with such inadequate laws and with such unsustainable resources. Second, the President can always dissolve Parliament again if it transpires that this experiment in good faith has not reaped results. He would have at least attempted to rise above politics, and ought to be recognised for doing so.

A path outside politics may be difficult for Sri Lankans to imagine, given everything we know about our political leaders. Yet we find ourselves in a unique moment in history that only comes once in a generation. Future generations will recall how we acted, and what we expected of our political leaders. A generation’s legacy will be defined by this moment. Let us hope that we, and our political leaders, choose to be on the right side of history."

277,277,https://www.thecoast.ca/halifax/the-history-of-earth-day-from-radical-roots-to-big-green-in-50-years/Content?oid=23931394,"The history of Earth Day, from radical roots to big green in 50 years",A longread from our CCNow partners at Teen Vogue.,www.thecoast.ca,"If you ask Adam Rome, Earth Day isn’t as punk as it used to be. “Earth Day is so tame nowadays,” says Rome, the author of The Genius of Earth Day: How a 1970 Teach-In Unexpectedly Made the First Green Generation. “For adults, it's often a trade show where you can see the latest green stuff, and for kids it's often a day with some corporate-sponsored lesson about what you can do individually to save the planet.”

But the first Earth Day in 1970, Rome says, was an “intense” day of protest and activism for the 20 million people who participated. “It was a day to ask soul-searching questions about why we had environmental problems,” Rome says.

It’s not just Rome who sees a short-sightedness in the way we mark Earth Day today. For Elizabeth Yeampierre, a Puerto Rican attorney and the executive director of Brooklyn-based community organization UPROSE, Earth Day is merely one marker in a long global history of environmental injustice.

“When you talk about Earth Day, for us, it's not 50 years, it's 500 years of extraction, it's 500 years since slavery, since colonialism,” she says. “And in those 500 years, our communities have managed to survive all of it. Now we are faced with the consequences of those 500 years.”

For better or worse, Earth Day is the closest that the modern environmental movement has to a birthday: a time to celebrate milestones, to look back and plot a way forward. And as Earth Day has morphed since its inception, this year promises to be radically different. The surge of energy from youth activism over the past few years has been impeded by the coronavirus and bans on in-person gatherings. Organizers are hoping that the energy of the original Earth Day can take hold with a new generation grappling with a rapidly changing world.

Environmental protections in the United States essentially did not exist 50 years ago. Before the 1970s, industries of all types were allowed to pollute with little to no oversight, and Americans were largely in the dark about the impact air and water pollution could have on their health.

Prior to the first Earth Day, people across the country were disturbed by a 1969 oil spill in California, and their environmental consciousness was beginning to be raised, thanks in part to Rachel Carson’s seminal 1962 book Silent Spring. Then, in 1970, senator Gaylord Nelson, a Democrat from Wisconsin, recruited grassroots organizers across the country to coordinate events on a single day—April 22—to educate the public on environmental issues.

The scale of the organizing effort involved in the first Earth Day was massive, but Earth Day didn’t happen in a vacuum. The year 1970 came after a tumultuous decade of social upheaval and change, with the Vietnam War mobilizing thousands of young people to speak out; second-wave feminism bringing women out of the home and into the workforce; and the civil rights movement providing a model for what a nationwide environmental organizing effort could look like.

“The original founders of Earth Day literally borrowed pages from the then-happening civil rights movement to engage in righteous civil disobedience, righteous group mass action, to have humanity look at environmental degradation and the degradation of lives of individuals,” Aaron Mair, the Sierra Club’s first black president, told The New Republic in 2017.

The result was a resounding success. Environmental safeguards that we consider basic today—the Environmental Protection Agency, the Clean Air and Water Acts, the Endangered Species Act—came about following the massive impact of the early-1970s movements.

According to Rome, Earth Day also gave rise to the formation of robust “eco infrastructure” around protecting the environment. Activists involved in the early movement went on to create new careers to protect the changes they’d made and continue pushing for more—as environmental lawyers, lobbyists, nonprofit leaders, professors. Newspapers hired reporters to write about environmental issues. Green groups like the Sierra Club, now a household name, beefed up membership and bulked up their activism, while many others were born in the day’s aftermath.

For a moment in the 1970s, the future looked bright, inclusive—and green.

When Yeampierre joined UPROSE in 1996, she says she considered herself a social justice activist, and she had no history of working on environmental issues. But as young people in the community began telling her their concerns, she recognized common fights.

“They started talking to me about asthma, about truck traffic, about paint,” she remembers. “It became clear that if we couldn’t breathe, we couldn’t fight against bad policing.”

It may seem now as though community-based organizations like UPROSE, which started organizing around climate justice in the early 2000s, would be the natural heirs to the grassroots organizers behind the early Earth Day movement. But throughout the ’90s and the 2000s, many small organizations felt that the mainstream green conversation—which focused on sustainability, enacting bipartisan climate policy and promoting climate science—left out the needs of justice activists.

Rome attributes much of this disconnect to the original Earth Day movement’s success. After agreeing to make changes to their business models to preserve the environment, companies began to recognize the financial cost of environmental regulations and push to have them relaxed. Ronald Reagan unleashed a wave of pro-business activity in the Republican Party , and the GOP took up the mantle of deregulation.

The “eco infrastructure” set up in the wake of Earth Day mobilized to save what their movement had created. With partisan divisiveness escalating, grassroots movements—including movements helmed by people of colour—were left by the wayside as a more nationally oriented white, middle-class environmental movement took hold.

“The big green groups are always happy to have the help of somebody who's not an environmentalist,” Rome explains. “A labour union wants to help them, great, but they're not on the street picketing when labour goes on strike. We think that the environmental movement is sort of lefty, but a lot of environmental organizations are not self-identified as part of a broader progressive movement.”

Yeampierre says that big green groups—which have carried the national conversation, run the policy agenda and received much of the green funding since Earth Day—have not only ignored activists of colour but exploited them.

“The big greens always knew who we were because we got into fights about the distribution of resources, the distribution of power, how the big greens would sort of heavy-foot into our communities and undermine the work that we were doing, how they would supplant not only our leadership, but make it impossible for us to move the dial,” she says. “The culture of these institutions has been an extractive culture.”

In late March, representatives from a coalition of grassroots green organizations held a press call to explain how the coronavirus crisis was changing their original plans for massive Earth Day demonstrations. Naina Agrawal-Hardin, a 17-year-old activist with the Sunrise Movement, sounded upbeat even as she acknowledged the huge changes taking hold.

The pandemic is a disaster, Agrawal-Hardin says, but “is also a moment of opportunity and of hope of rebuilding our society into one that works for all people.” She emphasized the movement’s demands for a “short-term COVID response which will prioritize people over profits,” part of a longer-term plan to “deliver a just and livable future for my generation.”

Other youth climate activists, like Zero Hour’s Jamie Margolin, have pointed out that the rapid global response to this health crisis shows that a similar mobilization is possible to address the climate emergency. And they’re trying to lead the way.

In 2019, 4 million people around the world took to the streets during one week in September as part of the largest-ever climate mobilization. A generation increasingly anxious and outraged about climate change helped persuade Americans that preserving the environment was inextricably linked to social, political and environmental justice—and that we don’t have a lot of time to figure out what to do about it.

Rome sees this kind of movement as returning to the spirit of the original Earth Day. “Now it’s often the local community groups that have the overwhelming focus on health” and justice, he says. “They live with the burden directly—they're the ones getting asthma; they're the ones getting cancer. In 1970, that was a major focus of a lot of Earth Day organizing, period.”

The coronavirus has cut millions of Americans off from health care, sources of income, community connection—all key elements that have traditionally enabled organizing to thrive.

It’s a daunting moment for climate activists to overcome. But the pandemic, Yeampierre says, is a harbinger of a future marked by disastrous extreme-weather events, and it's proof that we need to work toward environmental justice and preparedness right now.

“What do we do if a climate disrupts governance?” Yeampierre asks. “If climate disrupts all of our systems, how do we survive? How do we reclaim the traditions that were taught to us, so that we can create local livable economies, so that we can survive the impacts of what's coming?”

“ANZAC Day without two-up is bloody un-Australian. Our diggers fought for our right to play two-up on ANZAC Day, so it felt like my patriotic duty to throw together a game of online two-up.

“I couldn’t in good conscience not let Australians gamble away their dosh on ANZAC Day even if the pubs are closed.”

The game is just a bit of fun and doesn’t use real cash, which means it’s technically not gambling. Does this skirt the rule which bans it on almost every other day of the year except ANZAC Day? We’ll never know, because we’re not allowed into the site!

Of course, a bunch of online casinos already offer two-up where you can bet real money. But these sites involve a sign-up process which ruin the spontaneity of the game. And besides, online casinos are seedy AF.

The months-old girl tragically killed by coronavirus “went out looking like a princess” during her funeral — wearing the dress her newly minted firefighter dad had got her for his FDNY graduation ceremony that she didn’t live to see, the father told The Post in an emotional interview Thursday.

Jerel La Santa got the rose-gold dress with glittered roses for young Jay-Natalie La Santa to wear at his March 27 graduation, but the ceremony was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

But he felt blessed that she was able to wear it at her funeral weeks later, after she was claimed by the coronavirus at nearly 5 months old on Monday.

“She went out looking like a princess,” the 30-year-old told The Post, fighting back tears. “She had such a beautiful white little casket because we didn’t want her in a body bag.”

La Santa had just finished his first-ever shift as a New York City firefighter in The Bronx in late March when he found out little Jay-Natalie was in an emergency room.

“When I got to my car, there was a note from my mother — ya know I couldn’t have my phone on because I’m the new guy — to go to the ER, she’s there,” La Santa said Thursday, just three days after losing his daughter.

“That’s one way to start my career.”

Jay-Natalie, who had already struggled with a heart condition, was diagnosed with bronchitis and kept overnight because she had a fever, said her 29-year-old mother, Lindsey La Santa.

Doctors tested Jay-Natalie twice for COVID-19 — once on March 21 when she was admitted and again six days later — before realizing she had contracted the virus.

Lindsey La Santa said doctors were unsure if the child had it all along and the first test was a fluke — or if she picked it up in the ICU, which had been overflowing with adults and children.

By April 4, Jay-Natalie had to be intubated.

“She was so weak and lethargic,” Lindsey said. “From April to her last breath, she was just in a paralytic state.”

Only one parent was allowed at a time, so the mom and dad took 12-hour shifts at the hospital until April 20, when their infant’s vitals crashed.

“Everything is just perfect right now,” Jerel told Lindsey over the phone just before things went south, according to the mom.

She recalled: “We were hopeful … her numbers were beautiful, her oxygen levels were good. Then 10 minutes later he called me to come … ‘she doesn’t have a pulse.’ ”

Doctors tried for more than 30 minutes to save the infant, but they couldn’t — and she died a week before she’d be 5 months old.

Jerel was thankful on Thursday, though, saying they “were lucky compared to other people” who lost loved ones during the outbreak.

Little Jay-Natalie’s godmother is a funeral director, so Jerel and Lindsey were able to bathe their baby and put her in the dress that was previously set aside for Jerel’s graduation.

The godmother arranged for a private, informal ceremony at her funeral parlor — where the parents were able to say goodbye to Jay-Natalie, since the official services set for May 2 will have to be closed-casket.

Jerel’s fellow firefighters from Engine 63, Ladder 39 and Battalion 15 showed up for support — even though they didn’t really know him because he only worked the one shift, the grieving dad said.

After the outpouring of support, the parents said they will livestream the services.

“I like to think we were blessed,” he said of being able to hold an informal ceremony this week.

As of Thursday afternoon, a GoFundMe account had raised more than $30,000 for the parents to help pay for health care costs."

In these challenging times, the St. Louis Area Foodbank is challenging itself. The organization is aiming to distribute more than 10 million meals to people in need across the region by June 30.

""We said, 'Hey, wouldn't it be great if we could put a line in the sand and say we're going to distribute at least 10 million meals by the end of June?!'"" President and CEO Meredith Knopp said. ""I can tell you we're well on our way, and I expect us to blow that number out of the water.""

The food bank announced the goal Thursday, on the heels of receiving $502,563 from the Missouri Foundation for Health to aid in its coronavirus response. The organization typically serves half-a-million people in 26 counties in Missouri and Illinois; now, it says, there are even more people in need.

""This is unlike anything we’ve seen in the 45-year history of the St. Louis Area Foodbank,"" Knopp said. ""Right now, because of the coronavirus pandemic, we're seeing those number increase exponentially. In addition to the men and women that usually count on our support and services, there are so many more that have been furloughed from their jobs.""

The St. Louis Area Foodbank will use the money to buy more food and infant formula to meet increased demand and will also buy additional equipment and storage. The funding also enables the organization to hire 20 full-time temporary employees.

In collaboration with local schools, hospitals and other organizations, it has been distributing food at contactless drive-thru food distributions. It also delivers food to seniors through the Community Supplemental Food Program.

Temporary employee positions include truck drivers, warehouse and mobile programs staff, SNAP intake coordinators and food packers and sorters. Applicants can contact the recruitment firm Labor Finders' St. Louis location at 636-287-3709 or its St. Peters location at 636-244-9080.

Among the “low hanging fruit palliatives” which the operators want the Federal Government to consider is the Presidential Executive Order on Removal of VAT from all forms of transportation.

The association, in a statement, lamented that domestic airlines remained the only sub-sector in the transportation sector still paying VAT.

Daily Trust reports that the removal of VAT for domestic airlines had been approved since 2018 but more than one year after, the waiver is yet to be implemented.

Dear valued readers, subscribe to the Daily Trust e-paper to continue enjoying our diet of authoritative news. Kindly subscribe here

Minister of Aviation, Senator Hadi Sirika had, prior to the increase in VAT from five percent to 7.5 recently, assured that the ministry is “liaising with relevant MDAs to ensure the smooth implementation of the Presidential Order”.

Now that the industry is at a standstill following the suspension of flights operations because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the AON is revisiting the call for removal of VAT as part of the post-COVID-19 palliatives for airlines.

It would be recalled that the AON had said domestic airlines lost over N360bn since the suspension of flights on March 27.

In addition, the association called for suspension of all NCAA, FAAN, and NAMA charges for domestic operations within the country for 180 days.

Other fiscal palliatives the operators are canvassing include subsidy for payment of workers’ salaries at least to cover six months, support towards augmenting insurance premiums which are dollar denominated as well as augmenting payment for international leases and rentals on the over 120 grounded commercial aircraft that must be paid.

The operators also demanded access to forex at first tier rate.

The group stated: “We believe the above measures are practical steps that will be a win-win strategy for all players in the sector and that will jumpstart the wheel of the Nigerian economy to keep moving as it will cushion the impact on the financial exposure of the Nigerian economy.”

“It is our firm conviction that it is better to keep the aviation industry going today than to kill the goose that lays the golden egg at the expense of over 251,000 Nigeria aviation jobs and recovery of our fragile economy today”, it added."
290,290,https://www.citizensvoice.com/opinion/vigilance-data-key-to-momentum-1.2621045,"Vigilance, data key to momentum",,www.citizensvoice.com,"Even though deaths and new cases have increased, state-mandated business lockdowns and physical distancing appear finally to be “flattening the curve” of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The rate of infection has slowed in Pennsylvania, New York and most other places, allowing a ray of optimism that had been as rare as sunshine in February in Northeast Pennsylvania.

Adding to the hope is Gilead Science’s announcement that its drug remdesivir, which it developed to fight Ebola, had proved to be effective against COVID-19 in a clinical trial conducted by University of Chicago Medicine.

And, researchers at Oxford University, the University of Pittsburgh Center for Vaccine Research, and several other research centers around the world have said they have developed promising vaccines.

Such hope is deeply welcome in a nation wracked by health and economic anxiety. And now, several governors, including Gov. Tom Wolf of Pennsylvania, have rolled out plans to restart business activity and diminish the staggering unemployment caused by the pandemic.

But normalcy remains well beyond the near horizon. Recovery plans still preclude large gatherings and, therefore, much of the social activity to which Americans are accustomed, from dining out to sports events and concerts.

Vigilance — wearing masks in public places, maintaining physical distance, sound hygiene and especially vigorous hand-washing — remain crucial to finally defeating the virus.

Likewise, test-derived data are crucial to further steering the scope and speed of the recovery.

The nature of the contagion also has ensured that the nation’s social and economic recovery from it would be incremental. As hope rises for the opening phases of that recovery, it is as important as ever to maintain vigilance, comply with best practices, and gather the needed data."

The McDonald’s on Wyatt Earp Boulevard shut down its doors this week as two employees were confirmed to have tested positive for the coronavirus.

According to owner/operator Jamie Kuehl, the two employees are currently under medical care.

""Our highest priority is to protect the health and well-being of our people,"" Kuehl said. ""Out of an abundance of caution, we have temporarily closed the restaurant at 703 West Wyatt Earp Blvd. while a deep clean is performed and to ensure all employees are healthy.

""We expect to re-open the restaurant with limited hours later this week. As we re-open, we are committed to conducting daily wellness checks with all employees, continuing restaurant deep cleanings, providing masks and gloves to all employees, in addition to adhering to social distancing guidelines and enhanced hygiene procedures.""

McDonald’s remains in constant contact with its employees and continues to provide support at this time.

""Our people are the heart and soul of the McDonald’s family,"" Kuehl said. ""We are keeping these employees in our thoughts for a fast and full recovery.""

The second McDonald’s location, also owned and operated by Kuehl, at 2613 Central Ave., is still operational and is part of the McDonald's corporate initiative to assist the community, particularly, first responders and health care frontline workers.

According to McDonald's public relations manager Christopher Stanley, on Wednesday and running through May 5, the Central Avenue McDonald's restaurant among many others across the country will be giving away free ""Thank You Meals"" via drive-thru and carryout.

By simply showing a work badge, each meal will be served in the Happy Meal box and includes breakfast, lunch and dinner.

""As local business owners, we know that our communities need us now more than ever and we’re committed to continuing to serve them,"" said Kuehl. ""We are proud to be able support our neighbors who are on the front lines as first responders and healthcare workers with Thank You Meals.""

As of last week, McDonald's has donated close to $3.1 million in food support to local communities.

In partnership with Food Donation Connection, McDonald's has donated 3 million pounds of food, including dairy, produce and fruit to local charities and food banks to families in need.

In Dodge City, McDonald’s owner/operators distributed more than 2,500 free kid’s meals over the Easter holiday to ensure kids would have access to food.

According to Stanley, McDonald’s has implemented nearly 50 new safety measures to ensure the well-being of its employees, and continuing to explore additional safety steps in accordance with guidance issued by local and national health authorities, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The Kansas Department of Health and Environment report showed Ford County reached 208 cases on Wednesday. The hospitalization number remains at two with zero deaths.

As frustrations continue to escalate because of the rapid increase of local cases, the message still remains to be ignored.

On the Ford County Facebook page, a person commented on today's increase saying, ""This is going to keep happening unfortunately because there’s some people that just don’t care. For Example, a gentleman my husband works with was sent home yesterday because over the weekend him and his family decided to have a birthday party for his sister who by the way has tested positive and was tested positive at before the birthday party but still decided to have 30 people over to celebrate her birthday because she was feeling better.""

However, despite frustrations, testing for the coronavirus in Ford County reached 410 tests, a rise from 376 tests conducted on Tuesday.

To slow the spread of the virus, the need to do so comes down to the individual person.

""A lot of this is personal responsibility, so if we're taking precautions to social distance and take proper hygiene care and protect ourselves, that will help overall,"" Ford County administrator J.D. Gilbert said.

Regarding the non-congregate housing shelters for those infected in four Kansas counties including Ford County, KDHE said the project is still in the planning phase at this time.

In terms of if there will be a tabulation for cases that have recovered, KDHE communications director Kristi Zears said, ""Not at this time. We hope to include in the future. It would fall to local health department to track and many of them are overburdened right now.

""There are some that have started including it in their own numbers, which is a great start and we’re hopeful this can be added soon.""

The number of cases in the state reached 2,211 cases with 432 hospitalizations, 110 deaths and 17,992 negative tests conducted."

297,297,https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-donor-paid-trump-fundraisers-to-lobby-for-trump-bailout-2020-4,A Trump megadonor who hired Trump fundraisers to lobby the Trump administration got the biggest payout from the Paycheck Protection Program,"Monty Bennett, a Trump campaign donor, hired Jeff Miller and Roy Bailey, two Trump fundraisers, to lobby the Trump administration. He got $46 million.",www.businessinsider.com,"
• The biggest single recipient of COVID-19 bailout loans is a hotel chain controlled by the Dallas billionaire Monty Bennett — his companies received $58 million in loans this month.
• Last month, as the bailout package was being negotiated, Bennett's companies hired two Trump fundraisers as lobbyists, and Bennett made a $50,000 donation to Trump's joint fundraising committee.
• Bennett is one of dozens of tycoons rushing to pay Trump-connected lobbyists for access as the government spreads billions of dollars in economic relief, a Business Insider analysis of lobbying-disclosure records found.
• In addition to the loans, Bennett's companies benefited from new Department of Homeland Security guidance designating hotel workers as ""essential.""

The Dallas hotel magnate Monty Bennett was in trouble. The multibillion-dollar hotel conglomerate that he controls, walloped by the coronavirus pandemic, had laid off 95% of its workers and was behind on payments on $4 billion worth of debt.

So he did what other desperate companies have been doing in droves: He bought his way into Trump's world. While the economy is on lockdown, a coterie of lobbyists who boast of connections to the Trump White House are very much open for business.

Bennett's company Ashford Hotels Inc. and its affiliated subsidiaries had never hired a lobbyist in Washington before the COVID-19 crisis hit, according to lobbying databases. But in March, as Congress and the White House negotiated an unprecedented bailout package to salvage the economy, the company signed up a pair of Trump's key fundraisers, Jeff Miller and Roy Bailey, to lobby the White House and Treasury Department.

Within weeks, Bennett and his affiliated companies had become the largest beneficiaries of the Small Business Administration's Paycheck Protection Program, according to Securities and Exchange Commission records first reported by The Wall Street Journal. All told, Bennett's companies, which operate more than 128 hotels around the world under more than 20 brands, secured $58 million in bailout loans, more than Shake Shack and Ruth's Chris Steak House combined.

That's not bad when you consider that Bennett's companies paid out only $50,000 in lobbying fees.

However, in an apparent reversal, the Treasury Department demanded on Thursday afternoon that publicly traded companies—including three under Bennett's name—surrender the loaned funds by May 7, so that small businesses may access them.

""It is unlikely,"" the agency clarified, ""that a public company with substantial market value and access to capital markets will be able to make the required certification in good faith.""

Representatives for Bennett did not return multiple requests for comment emailed and left on voicemail. Miller did not return repeated requests for comment, including questions passed through an intermediary. An assistant to Bailey said she would pass the request to him, but he didn't reply.

Bennett wrote in a Medium post on March 17 that he was forced to lay off or furlough more than 6,000 employees. Of the federal aid, he told The Journal, ""75% or more of the proceeds will be used to bring our employees back to work with the balance to be used to pay utilities, rent, and debt service to lenders.""

Trump megadonor hires Trump lobbyists to bail out his company

Bennett himself is a prolific donor, having given more than $1.1 million to Trump and the Republican Party since the 2016 campaign cycle, according to Federal Election Commission records. On March 7, as talks of a massive federal bailout began to take shape, Bennett gave $50,000 to the Trump campaign's main fundraising committee, Trump Victory.

According to lobbying disclosures, Miller and Bailey, the former Trump fundraisers that Ashford hired, both attempted to influence Treasury Department officials on the company's behalf. The secretary of that agency, Steven Mnuchin, was not only the chief White House negotiator on the bailout bills but also the ringmaster of Trump's fundraising effort in 2016. He also has longstanding relationships with many of the donors still active in Trump's reelection effort.

The same month he hired Miller and Bailey, Bennett publicly urged the White House to bail out his industry in a series of posts on Medium. A March 22 post called ""What's wrong with America?"" bemoaned the timidity of politicians who hesitate to hand taxpayer dollars to struggling companies without assurances that they wouldn't simply line shareholders' pockets.

""Politicians are so terrified from appearing to help big businesses or companies that somehow make a profit that they put restrictions on aid that are onerous and counterproductive — sometimes even rendering the aid unusable,"" Bennett wrote. ""We should not be disqualified from assistance because we built our previously small businesses into bigger businesses. That's how we manage to put more Americans to work.""

The Paycheck Protection Program has formed the core of the Trump administration's attempts to protect the economy from the impact of social distancing. The program, which provides low-interest loans that will be forgiven if they're used to hire back laid-off workers, was designed to save small businesses from going under. The national burger and fry chain Shake Shack was pressured earlier this week to return the $10 million it received from the program.

Despite his ownership of a massive chain of hotels, Bennett said in his Medium posts that each hotel was itself a small business deserving federal assistance.

According to The Wall Street Journal, Bennett's companies continued to pay millions of dollars in dividends to preferred shareholders, including himself and his father, through March. The World Health Organization declared the coronavirus a pandemic on March 11, just as US states witnessed a fresh wave of new cases and millions of Americans began filing for unemployment.

A Treasury Department spokesman said Wednesday that loans are reviewed by individual loan processors at banks, not the department. He added that the loans are forgiven only if they are used to keep employees on payroll and pointed to Mnuchin's comments on Fox Business this week that large companies which take advantage of the program ""could be subject to investigation.""

The spokesman declined to answer when asked whether Miller and Bailey's lobbying of the department had any influence.

A White House spokesman deferred questions to the Small Business Administration, which administers the Paycheck Protection Program. A spokeswoman for the SBA said banks and lenders file with their office, make the loans, and then the SBA backs the loans on a first-come, first-served basis. The spokeswoman said it's an automated process.

Questions to the Trump campaign were not immediately returned.

A Business Insider review of lobbying-disclosure records and interviews with Republican sources have identified more than a dozen lobbyists with Trump ties who have signed up new clients or repurposed past relationships to help clients deal with COVID-19 and its continuing economic toll.

Ride-sharing and scooter companies, laundromats, gyms, and high-end pharmaceutical companies all found themselves suddenly and urgently in need of a line into the Trump administration. And they secured it through a slew of top fundraisers, campaign operatives, and former Trump aides offering their services as guides to Washington during the coronavirus pandemic — for a price, of course.

Chief among them are Miller's firm, Miller Strategies, and Ballard Partners, which is led by Brian Ballard, a veteran Florida lobbyist. They also include former top staffers who worked directly with the senior administration officials who are now deciding the fates of industries struggling to ride out the pandemic.

""Washington is a maze; it's a labyrinth, and many times clients need assistance when their businesses and their employees are hurting to navigate that maze,"" Justin Sayfie, a partner at Ballard Partners, said. ""So knowing which door to knock on is something we help our clients with.""

Demand for such expertise and connections is especially high as the US government response rapidly oscillates. On Friday, for example, the Department of Homeland Security issued new guidelines for which industries it considered essential to the country's operation through the pandemic — creating instant winners and losers for Trump-connected clients.

Ballard and Miller charge upward of $300,000 to $400,000 a year for the access and influence they can provide. ""They're printing money,"" one veteran Republican lobbyist said.

Clients have much to lose, and much to gain, from the pandemic

Ballard and Miller are hardly known outside the Beltway, but they both boast deep ties to the ever-shifting whirlwind of characters that blew into Washington, DC, with Trump's shocking electoral victory. Ballard comes out of Florida politics, where he led Trump's statewide fundraising effort, and he has signed up a team of Trump-linked people, including former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, who helped lead Trump's public defense in the impeachment trial.

As the threat of the coronavirus became clear about a month ago, Ballard started signing up new clients, records showed, including Getaround Inc., a Silicon Valley ride-sharing company; Bird, a scooter company that suffered through layoffs; and NanoPure, a chemical company that promises deep disinfecting of office spaces. They all had much to lose, or gain, from the pandemic.

Miller, the top political adviser to House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, is the vice finance chair of the 2020 Republican National Convention and a top fundraiser for Trump's reelection effort. In addition to Bennett's companies, his firm has signed up the California Business Roundtable, which represents midsize businesses facing existential threats; the airplane charter company iAero Group; and Nuclein LLC, a company the provides rapid testing for infectious diseases.

Miller did not respond to a request for comment.

And as Mnuchin emerged as Trump's quarterback for the ongoing economic rescue, negotiating trillions of dollars in stimulus spending with Congress, lobbyists with ties to him also booked new clients: Mnuchin's former director of legislative affairs Brad Bailey represented the American Investment Council; Matthew Kellogg, a former Treasury deputy assistant for legislative affairs, represented the global bank HSBC; and Jared Sawyer, a former Treasury deputy assistant secretary for financial policy, worked for the Bank of New York Mellon Corp.

The fight for what is deemed 'essential' work

All of that lobbying is starting to pay off.

On Friday, the Department of Homeland Security released updated guidance detailing which industries the federal government considers ""critical"" enough to remain open through the pandemic. The update included a couple of major changes desired by Trump-connected lobbying clients.

In one example, the department swapped out the word ""employees"" in previous guidance for the word ""workers,"" according to a document circulated in Washington's lobbying community showing changes from the last update to the guidance, which was issued at the end of March.

The change was a win for ride-sharing companies and gig workers who'd been left in the cold when the coronavirus first started to cause US illnesses and wreak havoc on the country's economy.

That was good news for the likes of Getaround Inc., the 10-year-old ride-sharing company headquartered in San Francisco that had signed up Ballard, Trump's Florida campaign chairman, to lobby on its behalf.

Bennett's Ashford Hotels could also claim a victory from a sentence inserted into the new DHS guidance that deemed hotels ""essential"" to provide services to first responders and healthcare workers.

When he was asked about the changes in the DHS guidelines, a DHS spokesman pointed to the press release issued on Friday, which said DHS had received ""feedback"" but did not specify where that feedback came from.

A White House spokesman did not return multiple requests for comment from Business Insider. Nor did a spokesman for the Trump campaign.

An ethics expert said it has 'the appearance of corruption and cronyism'

Virginia Canter, the former chief ethics counsel for President Barack Obama, said the proliferation of former Trump White House aides and campaign operatives signing up bailout clients reeks of the very ""swampiness"" Trump campaigned against.

""It gives the appearance of corruption and cronyism,"" said Canter, who now serves as the chief ethics counsel for Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a DC watchdog group.

Sayfie, a lobbyist working at Ballard Partners, told Business Insider in an interview that watchdogs and journalists often ignore what he regards as noble lobbying, citing his firm's representation of local hospital systems, such as Broward Health in South Florida, that serve the poor and uninsured.

""They're bleeding losses; they're preparing for a surge that isn't going to come,"" he said. ""How much money did these hospitals lose preparing for these storms that didn't come?"" Sayfie said. ""Who's going to make good on that?""

Sayfie denied that Ballard's lobbyists trade on Trump's name or promise special access to his officials when he was asked whether the fundraising Ballard does for Trump gives the firm special access.

""We never publicly or privately discuss people's relationships with any public official. That's not how we operate; it's not part of our vocabulary,"" Sayfie said.

The Ballard Partners website, however, prominently touts its partners' relationships with Trump and his campaign. Ballard's biography says his ""political portfolio includes significant roles in presidential campaigns including the historic election of President Donald J. Trump.""

Sayfie's biography recounts his connections to former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, former President George W. Bush, and former Sen. Mel Martinez. It also says that he ""was appointed by President Donald J. Trump to serve as a Commissioner on the President's Commission on White House Fellowship."""

What if April nears its end… Half Greece woke up in the middle of a snow landscape on Thursday, April 23, 2020. As meteorologists have forecast, the barometric low brought not only rainfalls but also snow, locally dense.

In the mountainous areas of Karditsa, south-west Macedonia, snow started to fall already on Wednesday night. Thursday morning, the white blanket around the Lake Plastira had reached a height of 30 cm.



Snow fell also in the mountainous areas of Larissa in Central Greece.

Dense snowfalls changed the landscape in Epirus, in western Greece, and had it look like Christmas in …spring.

In some areas temperature reached -3 degrees Celsius, while the average was at 0° C, notes local media epiruspost.

The barometric low has hit North and Central Greece with temperature drop, snow- and rainfalls and powerful north wind, while the South of the country records high temperature and Sahara dust due to strong south wind.

This is could be the last day of winter, though, as weather improvement is forecast as of Friday, April 24, 2020."

Actress Eva Longoria shares with her Instagram followers how she covers her gray roots at home in just 10 seconds.,www.today.com,"With salons closed for the time being and hair dye flying off the shelves, many of us are having to let our gray hair shine whether we like it or not. It turns out even celebrities are facing incoming gray roots, but Eva Longoria might just have the solution: L'Oréal Paris Magic Root Cover Up.

The actress shared an Instagram video on Tuesday showing how she uses the spray to hide her gray roots. Though Longoria is currently a spokesperson for L'Oréal Paris, the before and after results are undeniably impressive.

She starts the video by showing how her roots have been growing out during this time of social distancing.

""If you've been following me, you know I've been going gray,"" Longoria said before picking up a bottle of the spray. ""This thing is awesome because it has a little nozzle that makes it really specific.""

Longoria then applies a few sprays to her roots and along her hairline, which she says only took ""like 10 seconds."" According to the brand, the concealing spray temporarily provides coverage until your next shampoo.

She also pointed out that the product doesn't transfer to her skin, so it's safe to use after applying makeup. Longoria's famous friends were also impressed with the results, with stars such as Wilmer Valderrama and Olivia Munn sharing their love in the comments section.

""This is a must-have!!!"" Serena Williams exclaimed in the comments."

Now, he is to be the focus of a new ITV documentary to tell the story of the part he played in World War Two during a one-off special which is to be shown on VE Day.

The former British Army Officer raised more than £28million for the NHS by walking 100 lengths of his garden with his frame - after initially hoping to raise £1,000.

During the war, he fought in Burma and will share his memories of the conflict to draw attention to the “forgotten war” in the documentary.

The 30 minute show will air just a week after his own centenary celebrations and is titled Captain Tom's War.

Today, April 23, the war veteran was awarded a Pride of Britain award live on Good Morning Britain.

Of his win, he said: ""That is absolutely amazing. It’s very difficult for me to believe things like this. I know the Pride of Britain Award is a very important one, I can’t be more proud to be in a position to receive it from you.

""You are all so, so very kind. I thank all the people who nominated me for this award. I thank you very much because I am very, very humbled at receiving this magnificent award. Thank you all very, very much.""

During his documentary, Tom looks back on his time during the War in the brutal Burma campaign, as a million Allied troops from 40 nations attempted to repel the invading forces of Imperial Japan from the British colony over almost three years, between 1941 and 1944.

Captain Tom honours the soldiers who fought in what has since become known, with so much focus on the European battlefront and on VE Day, as 'The Forgotten War’, which finally came to an end in August 1945.

The fact the Burma campaign, fought in what is now known as Myanmar, remains relatively unknown is an issue for the Yorkshireman and it is why he committed to addressing the balance by making the programme.

Captain Tom’s War will also feature Tom’s daughters, Lucy and Hannah, who reveal family photos from their trip back to Burma.

Captain Tom entered officer training in 1940 at the age of 20, going on to serve in India before reaching Burma.

There, he was involved in the massive amphibious assault on Arakan, the instrumental part of recapturing the colony, before pushing on with his troops to the capital, Rangoon.

The documentary is produced by North One and will air on Friday May 8 at 8pm on ITV.

The commissioner is ITV's Controller of Current Affairs Tom Giles, who said: ""Captain Tom’s War will shed light on a campaign which comparatively goes unmentioned but in which our troops suffered unthinkable hardship and tens of thousands of British soldiers fought and died.

""Hearing this from Captain Tom Moore, who fought in Burma, means we will find out a lot more about the man who has done so much to raise our spirits at this time and the experience he and many others faced during World War Two on an occasion when we rightly come together to thank them for their sacrifice."""

The cybersecurity firm, ZecOps, began conducting research after finding suspicious lines of code on iPhones belonging to a client. Customers of ZecOps, a two-year-old cybersecurity firm with offices in San Francisco, instruct their employees to connect their iPhones to a computer or kiosk that uploads data logs to a central server, where they are analyzed for suspicious activity.

Zuk Avraham, ZecOps's CEO and co-founder, said that the code stood out because it wasn't found on many other iPhones. Avraham and others at the company investigated it for months, eventually discovering that it was connected to a previously unknown flaw Apple's mail app. It alerted Apple, which is fixing the flaw, he said.

The discovery of the flaw highlights a problem that has increasingly come to light in recent months. While Apple's marketing claims that its iPhones are better secured than the competition, its mobile operating system called iOS is particularly vulnerable to sophisticated attacks like the one that befell Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos last year. (Bezos also owns The Washington Post.)

Like the attack suspected on Bezos' phone, the hack that ZecOps says it discovered is referred to as a ""zero click"" attack. While less sophisticated attacks require the victim to click on a link, usually in a phishing email or text message, a zero click exploit requires no participation on the part of the victim. In this case, the perpetrators can send an email to the victim containing the malicious code. That code can then set off a chain reaction, called an ""exploit chain"" that knocks down all the phone's defenses one-by-one, erasing its tracks along the way and making nearly impossible to detect.

Avraham declined to name the clients he believes were targeted, but said in a blog post Thursday they include a Fortune 500 company in North America, a journalist in Europe, an executive in Japan and others.

ZecOps still has no idea who might have been behind the attacks that it says affected it clients, but Avraham said in an interview that he believes the attack was likely carried out by a nation-state or some of deep-pocketed entity.

Apple makes it difficult for security researchers to find bugs in iPhones, which both whittles down the number of people capable of prying into the operating system and simultaneously increases the value of exploits, which are sold on the black market to the highest bidder. Those bidders include nation-states and third party security companies that help deep-pocketed entities hack into their enemies' iPhones. Once an exploit is successful, Apple's locked-down security makes it nearly impossible for victims to know they've been hacked.

The murkiness of iOS makes the job of companies like ZecOps extremely difficult. Even with the ability to scan the logs of its clients' iPhones, the company is often only able to theorize whether there's been an attack, with varying degrees of certainty. That's what makes its most recent discovery so rare. It was able to essentially reverse-engineer suspicious activity and use it to discover an actual unknown security exploit.

While the hack raises questions about whether iPhone users should use the built-in mail app, removing it can create challenges for users. Even if an Apple customer deletes the Mail app, there is no way to change the default email application to a competing app, such as Microsoft's Outlook. Deleting the app can lead to a loss of functionality. For instance, clicking on an email link will no longer work and users will be greeted by a message from Apple requesting that they re-download the Mail app."

The Lilydale plant, located in Ramsay at 2126 Hurst Road S.E., is owned by Sofina Foods Inc. The company operates 16 plants across Canada.

The company said it was informed Tuesday by Alberta Health Services that one of its employees had tested positive for the coronavirus.

The employee is self-isolating at home and following AHS guidance, according to an email to CBC News from Daniele Dufour, senior director of communications, public relations and consumer inquiries for Sofina Foods.

Sofina Foods said the plant remains fully operational and has taken a number of steps to protect its workers.

""We met and reviewed our current COVID-19 practices with the Alberta Health Services, who confirmed that all necessary measures had been taken to protect the health of our employees and prevent further spread of the virus in the plant,"" Dufour wrote.

But the United Food and Commercial Workers Canada Union said it had sent a letter to Sofina Foods on Tuesday calling for the plant's closure.

""That plant in particular, it's an older facility, there are cramped quarters … listening to the members, we were getting so many calls as soon as the first case was announced,"" said UFCW local 401 spokesperson Michael Hughes.

""This is one case, but if Cargill has taught us anything … the way this virus is spreading, we have no idea how extensive this can be.""

COVID-19 has taken a particularly hard toll on the meat-packing sector.

A shutdown of an Olymel plant in Quebec was followed by Harmony Foods near Calgary and the Cargill plant near High River, Alta.

As of Wednesday, there were 580 cases linked to the outbreak at the Cargill facility — which is the largest outbreak in the country linked to a single location— and one worker has died.

The JBS meat plant in Brooks had 96 cases linked to it as of Wednesday and remains open, but production has been reduced to one shift.

As of Wednesday night, Hughes said the union had yet to receive a response to its letter.

""[At Cargill] you went from five cases on a Thursday to 38 on Sunday then 358 on Friday. And now we're over 500 [Cargill linked cases],"" Hughes said.

""We can't hesitate on this. If we're wrong calling for the closure and it saves one life, that's OK.""
• What led to Alberta's biggest outbreak? Cargill meat plant's hundreds of COVID-19 cases

The company says that as part of its COVID-19 preparation, it took steps to minimize risks to employees, including:
• Temperature checks for anyone entering its facilities.
• A ban on travel and limiting visits to facilities to essential needs only.

Alberta Health Services said it could not provide comment on individual cases Wednesday night.

The Lilydale plant is slated to move from Ramsay into the Dufferin North industrial area once construction is complete on a 268,000 square-foot facility."

Almost all of us, at some point in time, have fallen back upon our favourite authors to pull us through, and teach us a wide range of aspects about life. This World Book Day, bookworms across the world will not be able to celebrate by ordering their usual bunch of new books, or hit a public library for an elusive copy of John Purkis preface, which most likely went out of reprint decades ago. To make up for this, these five, free and public e-book libraries can offer you resplendent collections of e-books and audio books, which you can explore to satiate the craving of reading a new book today.

PS: Most of the following collections are not for profit ventures, as a result of which they do not earn by providing you with the collection of free, rare books. If you enjoy their service, do consider making donations in their favour, to keep the lights on for a fellow bookworm to discover in desperate times.

This is possibly one of the best known volunteer driven digital book library around the world, and the certified oldest library of its kind. Most of the works that have been saved and documented by Project Gutenberg pre-date the year 1924, and hence makes for a fantastic reservoir of pre- and post-World War I literature, the likes of which you will not find anywhere else across the internet. Project Gutenberg is also special for the way it has maintained itself – having started back in 1971 by American author Michael Hart, the library still maintains its volunteer driven, free for all approach.

The Internet Archive is a one-stop non-profit shop for all things uncommon on the internet – be it an elusive novel, a rare music album or movies that faded into oblivion. Archive’s collection of e-books include long-forgotten journals and memoirs, as well as digital drafts of manuscripts dating back by decades. In essence, what you get here is a collector’s heaven that can not just help you kill time, but build collection and knowledge par excellence.

The Open Library, on the other hand, has a terrific collection ranging from Stephen King and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, to J.K Rowling Agatha Christie. While Project Gutenberg’s appeal may primarily lie with academicians, Open Library offers something for everyone to read. The library is supported by voluntary donations, which is then invested in sponsoring e-books for interested readers. You may face some waiting time to be able to borrow the book of your choice, but be rest assured, the wait is worth it.

As the name suggests, this is one of the widest collections of PDF books across the internet. The best part about PDF Books World is its seemingly massive collection of authors across the ages, and its impeccable indexing of the excellent collection. From sorting through genres, sub-genres and authors, PDF Books World will give you a large enough e-book library to not just see you through the lockdown period, but actually keep you hooked for far, far longer.

The one super appealing factor behind ManyBooks is how it features an entire section for science fiction. It is also most likely one of the most intuitively designed and graphically appealing free e-book libraries on the internet, and its collection also features a whole variety of lesser known novels from across numerous genres, which you certainly wouldn’t be finishing in a hurry."

Several Kroger Marketplaces stores in Cincinnati and Dayton, Ohio and Northern Kentucky will soon ship outdoor furnishing products like patio dining sets, BBQs and more to consumers. The brand's Marketplace stores are known for carrying a selection of non-food products and groceries.

Frayt, which normally facilitates business-to-business deliveries, has seen a 250% increase in interest in its services since it started to deliver to consumers, according to Grocery Dive.

Kroger's expansion to furniture is a way to sell outdoor dining items to consumers when many of its competitors are closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, according to Grocery Dive.

Partnering with Frayt gives the grocer a better chance of competing against retailers like Target Corporation (NYSE: TGT) and Walmart Inc (NYSE: WMT).

If Kroger's initial trial proves to be successful, it could expand to many additional locations. Out of the total 2,757 stores under Kroger's umbrella, 183 are a Marketplace.

Kroger also owns more than 100 Fred Meyer stores in the Northwest region that carry similar furniture items and could potentially be tapped as well to deliver direct to the consumer.

310,310,http://freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/3838108/posts,The News That You Don't Hear: COVID-19 lockdowns are killing thousands of Americans,,freerepublic.com,"The hysteria drummed up by the mainstream media over COVID-19, in conjunction with the draconian lockdown measures being employed by many governors, is costing thousands of American lives. In light of horrific job losses and a crashing economy, calls to suicide hotlines are up over 40 percent nationwide. Although an increase in suicide calls does not necessarily translate to an increase in deaths, the fact that 132 Americans die by suicide daily is concerning. A 40-percent uptick would mean an increase of 53 deaths per day, if the calls indeed correlate to suicides. This translates to 1,590 deaths per month. Heart attacks are a major problem as well. Harlan M. Krumholz, a doctor at Yale New Haven Hospital, recently published an article in the New York Times titled ""Where Have All the Heart Attacks Gone?,"" which wondered why hospitals are eerily quiet, save for COVID-19 cases. What is striking is that many of the emergencies have disappeared. Heart attack and stroke teams, always poised to rush in and save lives, are mostly idle. This is not just at my hospital. My fellow cardiologists have shared with me that their cardiology consultations have shrunk, except those related to COVID-19. In an informal Twitter poll by @angioplastyorg, an online community of cardiologists, almost half of the respondents reported that they are seeing a 40 percent to 60 percent reduction in admissions for heart attacks; about 20 percent reported more than a 60 percent reduction. Where are all these patients going? Some are dying at home, as is the case in New York City, where paramedics are being directed to leave cardiac arrest sufferers at home if they can't get a pulse at the scene. Those who want to go to the hospital may be afraid to do so

As Dr. Krumholz writes in his New York Times piece: The most concerning possible explanation is that people stay home and suffer rather than risk coming to the hospital and getting infected with coronavirus. This theory suggests that COVID-19 has instilled fear of face-to-face medical care. As a result, many people with urgent health problems may be opting to remain at home rather than call for help. And when they do finally seek medical attention, it is often only after their condition has worsened. Doctors from Hong Kong reported an increase in patients coming to the hospital late in the course of their heart attack, when treatment is less likely to be lifesaving. As a result of the crashing economy, hospitals and medical facilities have furloughed doctors and staff, and people who want to seek treatment simply don't have the option. In dozens of states, governors have issued executive orders directing hospitals to stop non-urgent procedures and surgeries, which is devastating the health care industry, forcing pay cuts, layoffs, and financial uncertainty. Ultimately, this is having a negative impact on health and well-being.

Alcohol use is way up

 And Im sure a lot of people have had at least one panic attack 



I think the net effect is fewer deaths. Economic depression is a health benefit, provided we don’t get to starvation levels. Shutting down the general economy saves lives. Yes, some are lost that would have lived otherwise. That’s inevitable with a large population and varied causes of death. Moving to air bags saved lives, but killed small people who sit close to the steering wheel. 



“It is amazing how many of the old people on FR are so selfish and really dont give a flying f*&k about anyone else (definitely not all of them though). Certain ones have a panicky fear that is palpable.” It’s not really an age related thing. I’ve noticed lots of younger folks on social media who get outraged at the mere thought of people doing as they please. I’m the counter to the scared old person. I’m old, and I am angry to my bones about the loss of liberty, and the stupidity of Americans who cheer on this nonsense. The context is, I’m older, reasonably high risk. Financially stable, near retirement. I’m not negatively impacted my the lockdown in any major way. And yet, I’m so angry, I don’t have words for it. I don’t want to be angry, but I hate seeing our country destroyed while the morons around us are loving it."

For its ships Queen Mary 2 and Queen Victoria, Cunard is cancelling all sailings that were due to depart up to and including July 31, 2020. For Queen Elizabeth, the cruise line has taken the practical decision to cancel the entire Alaska season and all departures up to and including September 8, 2020.

""These are extraordinary times and this global outbreak continues to challenge Cunard and the travel industry as a whole,"" said Simon Palethorpe, President, Cunard. ""We would love nothing more than to bring our fleet back in to service, and give our guests the holidays they deserve and long for, but with the lockdowns and travel restrictions in place around the world, this is simply not possible at this time.""

""We have been sailing for 180 years and we look forward to many more,"" he added. ""We will get through these tough times together and look forward to welcoming our guests back on board again when the time is right.""

Cunard will be communicating with all guests, and their travel advisors, who are booked on affected voyages.

As Cunard has done previously during this pause period, guests who are booked on cancelled voyages will automatically be given a 125% Future Cruise Credit or have an option of a full refund. This may be used on any sailing before the end of March 2022, and the booking must be made by December 31, 2021. Guests may now also use their Future Cruise Credit for a second cabin to bring friends or family or to upgrade an existing booking. Full details of the changes to operations and options available to guests due to travel on cancelled voyages, can be found at www.cunard.com.

Travel advisor commission on all bookings fully paid by April 22, 2020 will be protected.

Cunard will continue to monitor government guidelines and travel restrictions around the world, and this may mean there are further changes to the timing of when each of the ships returns to service.

Full details on voyage cancellations and Cunard's current cancellation policies can be found on Cunard.com.

More than 4.4 million laid-off workers applied for U.S. unemployment benefits last week as job cuts escalated across an economy that remains all but shut down, the government said Thursday.

Roughly 26 million people have now filed for jobless aid in the five weeks since the coronavirus outbreak began forcing millions of employers to close their doors. About one in six American workers have now lost their jobs since mid-March, by far the worst string of layoffs on record. Economists have forecast that the unemployment rate for April could go as high as 20%."

EPA gave national recognition to Keene State College, in Keene, NH;",www.vermontbiz.com,"Vermont Business Magazine The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is awarding seven local New England organizations with recognition for their work keeping wasted food out of landfills and incinerators and putting it to better use, including Central Vermont Solid Waste Management District in Montpelier.

EPA gave national recognition to Keene State College, in Keene, N.H.; the Katharine Lee Bates Elementary School, in Wellesley, Mass.; and Signature Bread, in Chelsea, Mass.

Further, EPA gave regional recognition to the R.I. Dept. of Health: Rhode to End Hunger Initiative, in Providence, R.I.; the Island Grown Initiative to reduce food waste reduction and redirection project Marthas Vineyard, Mass.; the Central Vermont Solid Waste Management District food waste reduction for greener schools, in Montpelier, VT; and the Center for Ecotechnology, in Florence, Mass. for their project “Help Hartford County’s Hungry” in Hartford County, Conn.

The awards are part of EPA’s Food Recovery Challenge (FRC). The Food Recovery Challenge takes part in the efforts of the “Winning on Reducing Food Waste Initiative,” a partnership including EPA, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the Food and Drug Administration, to reduce food loss and waste through combined federal action.

“Food Recovery Challenge participants are leaders in showing how preventing food waste and diverting excess wholesome food to people is an environmental win and a cost-saving business decision,” said EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler. “Their accomplishments serve as excellent examples to other companies, governments, organizations and communities.”

“EPA is very pleased to recognize these New England businesses and organizations for doing excellent work preventing food waste and providing excess food to people in need,” said EPA New England Regional Administrator Dennis Deziel. “These actions can be a strong example to other organizations and communities who are working to reduce impacts on solid waste disposal and simultaneously ensure that edible foods are not wasted.”

was recognized nationally by EPA in the category of Data-driven Winner, Colleges/Universities. Keene State modified its food waste composting program in its common dining area in December 2017 to include all kitchen waste and post-consumer food waste. This significant expansion of collected and composted food waste was a critical step toward achieving the school’s ambitious goal of qualifying as a zero-waste campus by 2030. In a year, Keene State more than doubled the amount of food waste composted. The weight of compost collected increased from 41.76 tons in 2017 to 110.66 tons in 2018. The reduced cost for composting, compared to landfillings, saved the school $4,324. As a result, Keene State College expanded composting to other food service vendors in the Student Center beginning the summer of 2019.

“Keene State College is thrilled with the success of its expanded composting program. Not only does it move the college forward in attaining its ambitious zero-waste by 2030 goal, but it saves money and models full-circle composting—we love that compost generated from KSC food waste is returned to our campus landscaping as a nutrient-rich finished compost. The program is a “win-win” all around!” - Dr. Cary Gaunt, Director of Campus Sustainability, Keene State College.

was recognized nationally by EPA in the category of Data-driven Winner, K-12 Schools. In 2016, Bates Elementary School students partnered with local organizations to ascertain what was being wasted in their cafeteria and how to reduce that waste. A fifth-grade leadership team formed and developed recycling areas and signage, as well as taught fellow students about waste reduction and sustainable waste management at a school assembly. Students worked with town and school officials to create a program for single-stream recycling and food waste diversion in the cafeteria. That program has expanded to diverting unused liquids to an anaerobic digestion facility; donating unopened food to classrooms and the Wellesley Food Pantry; and recycling plastics, cardboard, aluminum, and paper. During 2018, each week the school donated about 29 pounds of excess food and diverted about 84 pounds of liquid food waste from the trash.

“I love that the concept and passion for the Food Recovery Program came from our students, as a fifth grade Student Council project. Our whole school community and town enthusiastically supported the idea and four years later continue to work hard to sustain this initiative. Our students are proud to participate in the Food Recovery Challenge."" - Toni Jolley, School Principal

was recognized nationally by EPA in the category of Data-driven Winner, Food Manufacturing. The company has held a long-term commitment to reducing its impact on the environment through reducing waste. The company has pursued projects including diverting dough and bread waste to composting operations or livestock feed; using a food waste compactor with an integrated scale to measure waste; and working with food banks and other local hunger relief organizations to find creative ways to donate excess bread. In 2018, Signature Breads processed over 3,000 tons of bread and dough into animal feed, and over a longer period of time they have donated over 4 tons of frozen bread to hunger relief organizations.

“Our belief has been to continuously look for opportunities within our business to reduce our environmental footprint. Whether small acts or large, our goal is to focus on moving in a positive direction that does less harm, while doing more good.” - Tony Rodriguez, President, Signature Breads

EPA New England also recognized four organizations regionally for their food reduction efforts including:

Center for EcoTechnology, Inc., located in Florence, Mass. was recognized for a project occuring in Hartford County, Conn. The Center for EcoTechnology (CET) learned that a significant barrier to donating edible food is liability concerns from businesses, schools, hotels, and other institutions that have significant food waste. CET worked with Connecticut state agencies to produce “Food Donation by Connecticut Schools,” a document with guidelines to help K-12 schools identify opportunities to donate food internally and externally. CET collaborated with the state agencies to ensure consistency across agency policies. The document consolidates federal and state regulations on share tables and partnerships with external food rescue organizations, including information on liability protection and health codes.

“CET is honored to receive this recognition for our work to reduce wasted food in partnership with EPA and many Connecticut and Hartford government agencies and businesses. The pioneering work among these partners is helping to advance better management of wasted food as a regular way of doing business in the region and across the country.” - John Majercak, CET president

was recognized for their Food Waste Reduction and Redirection Project, an island-wide effort on Martha’s Vineyard that works with food that was once taken away as waste and gives it to the hungry or composts it. The project, funded partially by an EPA Healthy Community Grant, created a community report explaining the cost to municipal budgets and to the environment of disposing food waste off the island. The project also helped residents, schools and businesses reduce food waste and separate significantly more food waste from trash. As a result of this project, all town transfer stations now accept food waste, tripling food waste collection from the previous year. Four years ago, all of Martha’s Vineyard food waste was shipped off the island as trash. The drastic change is largely due to the efforts of the Initiative and the island community which rallied around the idea that food waste is a valuable resource that can feed the island’s hungry, hens, or soil.

""Over the past year, through the work of IGI, the food waste collection at the transfer stations has gone from picking up a few toters per week in a pickup truck at three location, to bustling food waste drop-off centers at all six Island Local Drop-Offs. The expansion of IGI's composting program has demonstrated the demand for the service on-island. Now waste haulers are on board and the Martha's Vineyard Resource and Recovery District is looking at the potential of acquiring an in-vessel at their location.”

 - Donald Hatch, District Manager, Martha’s Vineyard Refuse Disposal and Resource Recovery District

was recognized for their “Rhode to End Hunger Initiative” in 2018 to promote food donation during department inspections and other outreach opportunities to restaurants and other food service organizations. In the Initiative, the department became the first state agency to use the MEANS Database, a nonprofit food rescue platform. The statewide effort connects food donors with local organizations to eliminate food insecurity. The department’s trained food safety inspectors continue to partner with public health scholars, community partners and the MEANS Database team on the Rhode to End Hunger. The initiative prevented 30,680 pounds of food from being disposed in Rhode Island’s Central Landfill in 2019. This effort has been successful due to connections built with local and national agencies.

“Rhode Islanders deserve access to healthy, wholesome food, no matter what zip code they live in.”

 - Dr. Nicole Alexander-Scott, director of the R.I. Department of Health

was recognized by EPA New England because, since 2004, the Central Vermont Solid Waste Management District (CVSWMD) has worked with its 27 schools to implement food scrap hauling and food waste prevention services. The District’s 2019 project, “Food Waste Reduction for Greener Schools in Central Vermont,” focused directly on reducing wasted edible food and milk in schools in five Vermont towns: Barre Town, Bradford, East Montpelier, Montpelier, and Williamstown. During the 2018-19 school year, participating schools decreased food waste by an average of 17.4 percent and milk waste by 41 percent. Every school surveyed also reduced the portion of food disposed of in their trash, and participating schools as a group decreased the weight of food in the trash by 45 percent.

“This project helped us refine our methods for measuring wasted food and showed that several strategies for reducing waste can actually work. We look forward to bringing these successes to more schools in the future.” - Brenna Toman, School Zero Waste Coordinator

In 2018, EPA New England worked with 53 New England-based Food Recovery Challenge participants to reduce wasted food, by diverting approximately 50,000 tons of food for donation or composting.

Food is a valuable resource. Efforts to reduce food waste and ensure excess food doesn’t go to waste are needed now more than ever. The innovation these businesses are showcasing can serve as examples as the nation works together to address the COVID-19 public health emergency. Over 1,000 businesses, governments and organizations participated in EPA’s Food Recovery Challenge in 2019. Participants prevented or diverted over 815,000 tons of food from entering landfills or incinerators, saving participants up to $42.3 million in avoided landfill tipping fees. The strategies used by FRC organizations to reduce wasting food, plus those implemented by individuals, communities and public-private partnerships, will bring the United States closer to meeting the National goal to reduce food waste by 50 percent by the year 2030 or to 109 pounds of waste food per person per year.

Food waste is the single largest type of waste thrown away each year in our daily trash. In 2017, more than 40 million tons of food waste was generated. Food waste adversely impacts the economy, our communities and the environment by wasting the resources used to grow and transport food. At the same time, approximately 11 percent of America’s households had difficulty providing enough food for all of their family members in 2018. Hungry people in need would benefit from the redirection of nutritious, wholesome food that would have otherwise been thrown away. The strategies used by Food Recovery Challenge organizations, plus those implemented by individuals, communities and public-private partnerships help to lessen these impacts and bring the United States closer to meeting the national goal to reduce food waste by 50 percent by the year 2030.

Nationally, EPA recognizes Food Recovery Challenge participants and endorsers with awards in two categories: data-driven and narrative. The data-driven award recipients achieved the highest percent increases in their sector comparing year to year data. Narrative award winners made notable achievements in the areas of source reduction, leadership, innovation, education and outreach, and endorsement."

My father was a refugee from Palestine, my mother, also a refugee, from Syria. They met in the camps of Sabra and Shatila in Beirut, Lebanon – a country deeply divided by religion.

Displaced first- and second-generation Muslims primarily populated my refugee camp. Maronite Christians ran the ruling class. Palestine, from where my father’s family had fled, had become the Jewish State of Israel.

My childhood and early adolescence were marked by devastation and war.

In 1982, at the age of 18, I was barely a young man. But I could tell you the difference between an incoming missile and an outgoing one.

I could tell you what pieces of shrapnel could be used for toys for children and which would explode in your hand.

I thought I had seen everything war and infighting could offer. Then the massacre happened.

My family had heard war was coming and fled to a nearby town to avoid it. I could not be dissuaded from staying.

I was a white helmet and knew the streets well. I thought I could help those injured and get them to safety using backroads of which invaders would not be aware.

I ended up witnessing the worst of humanity. I saw brutal murders of unarmed and completely defenseless neighbors.

People I had grown up with were slaughtered. Pregnant women and their children were butchered as their “Christian” slayers cried out for vengeance in the name of Jesus and Mary. I, too, cried out to Jesus and Mary as I hid in a metal chimney flu for days.

When the bloodshed stopped and I came out to see what was left, I saw crosses painted on doors in the blood of the slaughtered.

Ironically, when the Red Cross showed up to help with medical for the few survivors, their emergency vehicles also had this symbol of a red cross. Only this one provided hope.

Sermons at the mosques after the massacre were very hate-filled toward the Christians and the Jews, because Israeli forces had the power to stop the massacre, but instead waited in the hills and watched it happen.

But even though I had seen such inhumanity, such vile hate, I knew those messages from the pulpit were wrong.

I knew this because there had been a woman. A very kind and generous teacher named Ms. Rahma. She was deeply influential in my early childhood.

Before her, I had never known anyone to be so humble and selfless. She fed me when I was hungry, held me when I was traumatized and gave me sweets from a glass jar she kept in her classroom as a treat.

She was one of the most beautiful and merciful humans one could meet. And she was a Christian nun.

I believe God planted interfaith in me before I knew what that was. Now that I am an American imam, I know how important kindness across faiths is.

Had it not been for my positive experiences with Ms. Rahma, and the few other kind and compassionate Christians I have met, I too may have been filled with hate.

I could perhaps be living a life where I could look at another and think they were less than human.

Because of this, I have dedicated my life to showing and teaching others how important interfaith work is.

Interfaith work is not just about sharing theology. Interfaith work is about sharing humanity.

It’s about truly seeing each other and allowing our differences to be understood and accepted, even appreciated.

When I teach interfaith dialogue in my classes at Oklahoma City University, I always start with saying, “lend me your E.A.R.” (Educate. Attitude. Relationship.)

In order for us to find peace among religions, we must first educate. We must educate ourselves on what others believe. Find what gives them peace and hope.

We must have the right attitude. As we learn from one another, we must be open to truly listening without judgment.

Finally, we must have relationship. This is the most important.

It was because of the relationship I had with Ms. Rahma that I was unable to lump all Christians together and hate them, even after I had seen them slaughter my friends and neighbors.

Today, I have friends who are rabbis, pastors and priests, Buddhists, Hindus and Sheiks.

It is not in human nature to want to hurt one another. It is only when we are led to believe others are less than human that we are able to commit such atrocities against our neighbors.

Without interfaith relationships and dialogue, we cannot as a society hope to attain justice, peace and the common good of all.

In Oklahoma City, we have a very strong interfaith community.

Interfaith community came to stand in solidarity at Muslim Day at the Capitol when we had protestors; they came in solidarity with the Muslim community when anti-sharia legislation was being presented.

When people protested the Oklahoma Chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations’ participation in a Veterans Day parade, the interfaith community created a wall of love to protect us.

When I was denied the opportunity to be chaplain of the day in the Oklahoma House of Representatives, Oklahoma Conference of Churches spontaneously went to Representative Chuck Strohm’s (R-Jenks) office to inquire the reason.

We’ve moved beyond coexistence to interfaith engagement in the public sphere.

Next Biometrics has received its first commercial purchase order from a new business partner in India for 1,000 of its One Touch ID Fingerprint Modules to be implemented in fingerprint-enabled payment terminals, the company announced.

The biometric payment systems are part of India’s strategy to roll out fingerprint identification and authentication for secure financial services in the country. As this is an initial purchase order, the company expects additional orders following the launch. The Indian business partner will also test the Next PIV certified FAP20 sensors for release to international markets.

“We are pleased to announce this first commercial order from our highly valued business partner,” said Peter Heuman, CEO of Next Biometrics, in a prepared statement. “This initial order will not have a significant revenue impact, but it is a proof-point of our customer focus, technology edge and perseverance in spite of the global COVID-19 challenges.”

In December, Next Biometrics was granted Personal Identity Verification (PIV) certification by the FBI in the United States for its biometric module based on the large-size FAP20 sensor. The first purchase order for the One Touch 2000 modules was announced at the beginning of March also for integration in POS terminals.

Last month Next Biometrics received an order valued at $360,000 for its UIDAI and STQC-certified biometric fingerprint readers from a customer in India. The order followed a $750,000 purchase by the same company in January.

Next Biometrics recently announced it was undertaking another set of cost reduction steps to optimize its fingerprints business in the face of challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic."

(NYSE: FE) today reported first quarter 2020 GAAP earnings of $74 million, or $0.14 per basic and diluted share of common...",www.prnewswire.com,"AKRON, Ohio, April 23, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- FirstEnergy Corp. (NYSE: FE) today reported first quarter 2020 GAAP earnings of $74 million, or $0.14 per basic and diluted share of common stock, on revenue of $2.7 billion, including a non-cash mark-to-market adjustment on the company's pension and other post-employment benefit (OPEB) plans. In the first quarter of 2019, FirstEnergy reported GAAP earnings of $315 million, or $0.59 per basic and diluted share of common stock, on revenue of $2.9 billion. Results for both periods include the impact of special items listed below.

Operating (non-GAAP) earnings* for the first quarter of 2020 were $0.66 per share, above the midpoint of the company's earnings guidance. In the first quarter of 2019, operating (non-GAAP) earnings were $0.67 per share.

""During this global health crisis, we continue working to provide the safe, reliable energy our customers and communities need, while taking extra steps to keep our employees healthy on the job,"" said Charles E. Jones, FirstEnergy president and chief executive officer. ""While the broad, long-term implications on our economy are still being understood, FirstEnergy is uniquely well-positioned to navigate this environment, and we expect to continue meeting our commitments to our stakeholders.""

For the second quarter of 2020, FirstEnergy is providing a GAAP and operating (non-GAAP) forecast range of $260 million to $315 million, or $0.48 to $0.58 per share based on 542 million shares outstanding.

For 2020, FirstEnergy is updating its full-year GAAP earnings forecast range to $1.02 billion to $1.13 billion, or $1.88 to $2.08 per share, based on 542 million shares. The company is affirming its full-year operating (non-GAAP) guidance of $2.40 to $2.60 per share.

FirstEnergy is also affirming its long-term growth rate projections. The company remains on track to achieve 6% to 8% compound annual operating (non-GAAP) earnings growth (CAGR)** from 2018 to 2021, as well as its extended CAGR of 5% to 7% through 2023. That projection includes plans to issue up to $600 million of equity annually starting in 2022 to fund the company's regulated growth initiatives.

In FirstEnergy's Regulated Distribution business, first quarter 2020 operating results benefited from the implementation of decoupled rates in Ohio, incremental rider revenues in Ohio and Pennsylvania, and lower expenses compared to the first quarter of 2019. These factors were offset by the impact of mild temperatures on distribution deliveries, the absence of the Ohio Distribution Modernization Rider, and higher depreciation and net financing costs.

Total distribution deliveries decreased 7.8% compared to the first quarter of 2019 due to mild temperatures and lower usage. Residential sales decreased 12.6%, driven by a nearly 18% decrease in heating degree days compared to the first quarter of 2019. Commercial deliveries decreased 7.5%, while sales to industrial customers decreased 3.0%.

In the Regulated Transmission business, first quarter 2020 operating results increased primarily due to higher rate base associated with the company's ongoing investments in its Energizing the Future transmission program, which offset higher net financing costs.

In the Corporate/Other segment, first quarter 2020 operating results reflect lower expenses compared to the same quarter of 2019.

* Operating earnings (loss) excludes ""special items"" as described below, and is a non-GAAP financial measure. Special items represent charges incurred or benefits realized that management believes are not indicative of, or may obscure trends useful in evaluating the company's ongoing core activities and results of operations or otherwise warrant separate classification. Special items also reflect the adjustment to include the full impact of share dilution from the $2.5 billion equity issuance in January 2018. Special items are not necessarily non-recurring. Management uses Operating earnings (loss) and Operating earnings (loss) per share to evaluate the company's performance and manage its operations and frequently references these non-GAAP financial measures in its decision making, using them to facilitate historical and ongoing performance comparisons. Additionally, management uses Operating earnings (loss) per share by segment to further evaluate the company's performance by segment and references this non-GAAP financial measure in its decision making. Operating earnings (loss) per share and operating earnings (loss) per share for each segment is calculated by dividing Operating earnings (loss), which excludes specials items as discussed herein, for the periods presented in the first quarter of 2019 and full year 2019 by 539 million shares, 541 million shares in the first quarter of 2020, and 542 million shares in the second quarter of 2020 and full year 2020. which reflects the full impact of share dilution from the equity issuance in January 2018. Management believes that the non-GAAP financial measures of Operating earnings (loss) and Operating earnings (loss) per share and Operating earnings (loss) per share by segment provide consistent and comparable measures of performance of its businesses on an ongoing basis. Management also believes that such measures are useful to shareholders and other interested parties to understand performance trends and evaluate the company against its peer group by presenting period-over-period operating results without the effect of certain charges or benefits that may not be consistent or comparable across periods or across the company's peer group. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's historical or future financial performance, financial position, or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP).

Severson Dells Nature Center wants you to participate in a scientific research project by getting outside and taking,www.northernpublicradio.org,"Calling all citizen scientists! Severson Dells Nature Center wants you to participate in a scientific research project by getting outside and taking pictures of nature.

The City Nature Challenge is open to anyone with a smartphone in Winnebago, Boone, DeKalb, Ogle and Stephenson counties. Andrea Wallace Noble is a naturalist and educator with Severson Dells. She says to participate you need to download the iNaturalist app. It's free for both Apple and Android phones.

After you download the app, she emphasized that any kind of documentation will be appreciated.

""Whether people are taking photos of oak trees,"" she said, ""or bird or rare species or very common species -- any kind of post is helpful to us to gain biodiversity information and continue to document wildlife.""

Wallace Noble said to make sure the area you visit is open to the public and to factor safety into your photo-gathering by respecting social distance guidelines and obeying local laws. She said there are plenty of safe places to explore.

""We have so many wonderful forest preserves in Winnebago County in particular. We have 43,"" Wallace Noble said. ""Some of our more popular forest preserves like Deer Run and Blackhawk Springs and Severson Dells see a lot of people. So if people are interested in staying safe and really obeying those social distance guidelines, we encourage them to try new forest preserves, too.""

As for her favorite forest preserve?

""That's a hard one to choose,"" she said, ""but one of my favorites is Oak Ridge Forest Preserve. It features the south branch of the Kishwaukee River and some wonderful oak savannas and some really special habitats.""

The City Nature Challenge is an international effort to document wildlife on iNaturalist. It's organized by the California Academy of Sciences and Los Angeles Museum of Natural History. It runs April 24-27.

“Nobody saw this coming, and it came on like a hurricane, but without any…advanced warning, and so the industry is devastated,” said Boston real estate developer and hotelier Richard Friedman while speaking with Emily Rooney on Greater Boston Thursday. “And so it’s a disastrous situation for the owners, [and] it’s really disastrous for the workers.”

In the Boston/Cambridge area, some 18,000 hotel workers have been laid off, according to the Massachusetts Lodging Association.

“There’s some relief that people are getting from some lenders, but the government has not done enough for the hotel industry,” he contended.

He said that two of the hotels he developed — the Charles Street Hotel in Cambridge and the Liberty Hotel in Boston — had some health workers or first responders staying in their rooms, and that the Four Seasons Hotel at One Dalton Street has had some guests who were staying in Boston for medical treatment.

“You can’t take a reservation,” Friedman explained, noting Governor Baker’s statewide order that closed hotels for leisure purposes, only allowing them to house frontline workers and displaced people.

“We’ve stayed open for people who — nurses or doctors — who want to stay a night, or something like that,” Friedman said. “Sometimes these workers in the hospital are working so hard, they don’t want to go home to their family in Lowell, or wherever they live, and they’ve been in Intensive Care all day long, and they want to stay in the hotel and be safe and be close to work. So those are the kinds of people [we have]. But it hasn’t been as much of those people as we had expected, frankly.”"

Ohio State defensive end Chase Young was taken by the Washington Redskins as the second pick, followed by Ohio State cornerback Jeff Okudah, who went to the Detroit Lions.

The first round of the NFL draft, held Thursday night, gave millions of Americans a chance to watch a major sporting event, albeit not an actual game, live for the first time in weeks after the coronavirus pandemic forced cancellations and postponements across the country. The NFL announced Thursday night that the 2022 draft will take place in Las Vegas, after 2020's draft arrangements in the city were canceled due to the virus.

Rounds 2 and 3 of the draft are slated for Friday at 7 p.m. Eastern time and rounds 4-7 are set for Saturday, starting at noon Eastern.

Baltimore Ravens defensive end Calais Campbell, a member of the executive committee for the players' union, told ""CBS This Morning: Saturday"" co-host Dana Jacobson that health is a concern for players. Campbell's close friend Von Miller is one of two NFL players who've tested positive for COVID-19.

""It's pretty scary, and that goes into going back to work,"" Campbell told Jacobson. ""We could all be sick and not even know it. Some of us might not have symptoms, and that's pretty scary.""

It was the one point of light amid the medieval darkness that appears to have enveloped St Joseph’s Orphanage at Neerkol for much of the 20th century.

“Sister Regis” and “Sister Marcia’’ were given credence for being “nice’’ to children who were allegedly routinely slapped, flogged, starved, sodomised and ridiculed by nuns who would place dunce caps on their heads in this Christian refuge for orphans west of Rockhampton, now looming in the public mind as a charnel house of depravity.

But it was Sister Emile alone who honoured her vows of service to the poor and vulnerable, even if she wasn’t brave enough to stick her neck out and end the serial rape of young David Owen.

Millions of women have taken those solemn vows since Catherine McAuley, still on the Vatican’s slow track to sainthood, established the holy order of the Sisters of Mercy in Dublin in 1831.

Yet on Thursday morning in a courtroom in Rockhampton as David told his extraordinary story in that slow, methodical monotone of the lifetime illiterate, it was clear that bastardry, not mercy, shaped the life of this man so hardened that when the screws threw him down into the notorious “Black Hole’’ at Brisbane’s Boggo Road jail for a stint of solitary confinement, he liked it.

“I preferred my time in a solitary cell to being in the outside world,’’ he said.

Being alone means safety and a certainty no voice will rap out that hideous command still capable of chilling the marrow in his old bones: “Number 34 Dave Owen, you are wanted at the presbytery.’’

Much of the evidence heard from a dozen witnesses who appeared this week at the Royal Commission appears, on face value, preposterous.

That nuns routinely delivered up 12-year-old boys to flagrantly pedophile priests, that runaway boys were horse-whipped like 19th century Alabama slaves, that the scourge of Australia’s convicts – the cat o’ nine tails – was unleashed on children in the mid 20th century defies belief for anyone living your standard, boiler plate, Australian life.

Yet those claims were aired this week in a forum which, quite rightly, keeps to its charter and doesn’t aggressively challenge allegations.

Some witnesses are, by their own admission, deeply damaged human beings.

The cornerstone of the Christian faith many still profess – “we forgive those who trespass against us’’ – wasn’t gaining much traction on the second floor of the Rockhampton court complex.

Yet David was a little different, recalling the rapes and floggings, sounding like the old tired old prison lag/labourer/rugby league footballer he once was.

David was the result of a policeman’s rape of his 12-year-old mother in a north Queensland mining town and he arrived as a five-month-old baby at Neerkol in January 1939 after attempts by the Cairns District Hospital to find adoptive parents failed.

One day, Father Anderson told the adolescent boy he needed improvement on his Latin, invited him to the presbytery and sodomised him.

That was the day the words – “Number 34 Dave Owen, you are wanted at the presbytery’’ – began to fill him with fear and self-loathing.

David soon accepted the Sisters Of Mercy knew what was happening.

Sister Emile knew, tending his wounds after each attack.

“She started looking after my backside when I was 14 – I could not go to the doctor to be examined.’’

Commissioner Andrew Murray pressed the issue: Were there not any more nuns who offered even a morsel of kindness?

David said newly arrived nuns might object to the brutality, but were soon beaten into submission by the older hands whose sadistic natures appeared to ensure their dominion in the power hierarchy.

There might be room in the Neerkol story for that old adage “different times, different attitudes’’.

One story brings to vivid life the calibre of these tough-as-teak women who ruled over him.

The nuns organised boxing matches and one day David, watching a boy beat up a girl, felt a twinge of sympathy for the vanquished.

He challenged the boy and won, but the nun organising the fight challenged David.

She pulled up her habit, tucked it into her underpants “Bombay bloomers style,” strapped on the gloves and gave David one of the great floggings of his life.

A brutal lesson on the harsh realities awaiting a poor boy beyond the orphanage gates? Perhaps.

But one more anecdote suggest the nuns actually revelled in a strange, sadistic form of emotional cruelty, with no purpose other than to bring the perpetrator some twisted form of pleasure.

Each Christmas the nuns would present the kids with a box brightly wrapped in Christmas paper.

The first time he received his gift David, like any little boy, tore it open eagerly.

It was always empty, every Christmas at Neerkol.

The inquiry’s hearings in Rockhampton are continuing."

Town clerk Clare Baxter said: “We started the first week with about 6 meals a day, about 35 the second week and it’s just gone bigger and bigger.

“We do around 100 now a day, we’ve got three delivery teams on it. It has been an extremely successful project.

“We’re managing to put this project together on a skeleton staff and we’re looking after our community as best we can.

Offering hot and cold meals at a subsidised price of just £3, the council have already helped dozens of residents, and have even extended their scheme to cover South Kirkby and Moorthorpe.

The team have received thank you cards from many of their customers, as well as people who are relying on the town council to care for their relatives while they isolate elsewhere.

They are now delivering food essentials and medications to those in need, and hope to roll out a scheme to support children who are entitled to free school meals.

With help from South Elmsall Community Facilities, the team have also been able to organise emergency food packages for residents seeking help from Wakefield Council.

But Clare said the team were facing many of the same problems as other community groups - including a lack of masks and other protective equipment.

She said: “We’re struggling a little bit for PPE, even though we’re willing to pay for it.

Inayawan Barangay Captain Kirk Bryan Repollo told CDN Digital that they have decided to lock down the sitio (sub-village) where the symptomatic case of coronavirus disease was reported.

He did not reveal the name of the sitio since the sub-village was not confirmed by the City Health Department or the Department of Health.

Inayawan is the 8th largest barangay in Cebu City that borders the south from Talisay City.

“Sa pagkakaron, ato nang gi lockdown ang sitio kung asa gapuyo ang giingon pasyente. Ato nang gipabantayan ang entrance ug exit sa maong Sitio. (As of now we have locked down the sitio where the patient lived. We also ordered security on the entrances and exits),” said the village chief.

Repollo said the residents of the sitio have been cooperative so far with most of them volunteering to guard the sitio from outsiders and ensuring the residents stay inside their homes.

Since the possibility that the patient may have frequented the nearby Inayawan Public Market as well, Repollo ordered its temporary closure for thorough disinfection.

He said they are studying now the system they will adapt to ensure safety in the market. This system has to be in place before they reopen the market.

For the meantime, the vendors are staying at the barangay gym so they can continue selling goods to residents.

“We will assess when we can open the market again,” he said. /bmjo"

330,330,https://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/news/leicester-news/nhs-bosses-issue-important-advice-4070859,The NHS message over medical care during coronavirus crisis,Changes have been made at doctors' surgeries and hospitals due to the virus crisis,www.leicestermercury.co.uk,"NHS bosses have issued important advice for people needing non-coronavirus care and treatment.

The NHS in Leicester, Leicestershire and Rutland is urging patients to continue accessing health services for symptoms and conditions requiring medical care.

It says patients requiring medical attention for serious conditions must seek treatment immediately.

Parents of sick children are urged to seek advice and treatment by phoning their GP practice in the first instance, NHS 111, or in the case of an emergency, by accessing emergency services.

The county’s clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) say GP surgeries have quickly responded to the coronavirus pandemic by changing the way in which they deliver GP services to protect patients from the spread of infection.
• Most routine face to face appointments have been cancelled although the most vulnerable patients and urgent cases may still be seen in person.
• Patients should access GP services by phoning their practice or checking their practice website for further information on how to access care.
• Patients will be assessed initially on the telephone or via video link by a health professional and In some cases, patients will be asked to attend their practice. However, patients should not attend their practice without an appointment.
• Specific clinics have been established to help support patients with coronavirus symptoms that require a face to face consultation.
• Patients should always contact their GP in the first instance by phone and seek advice and if after consultation, the GP determines a follow-up is required, the GP will book the patient into one of the clinics in LLR where they will be seen by an experienced GP or Advanced Practitioner.
• People who need to access urgent care services or a minor injury unit should also book an appointment through their practice or NHS 111, rather than walk-in. This will ensure that they can access the best possible services while protecting themselves and others.

People needing emergency care can still access it, night or day at Leicester Royal Infirmary.
• To encourage social distancing and keep patients and staff safe over the coming weeks, patients will notice that the children and adult departments have been temporarily split into “blue” and “red” zones. The colours will enable staff to keep patients with similar needs and symptoms together. Patients will still be assessed by a hospital clinician on entry and then directed to the appropriate area for their needs.
• Visiting restrictions are still in place at all UHL (University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust) and Leicestershire Partnership NHS Trust (LPT) hospital sites, but carers and parents are encouraged to attend with patients aged under 18 and vulnerable adults.
• At LPT, alongside increased capacity and new wards at the community hospitals, new referrals pathways and support have been created for mental health patients with UHL, reducing the need to attend the emergency department at Leicester Royal Infirmary.

A new central access point for mental health is being launched to provide a direct number 24/7 to referrers and service users for mental health support.

Healthy Together (health visiting and school nursing) services are also being delivered differently at this time.

Most contacts are now provided over the phone, with face-to-face visits offered only where absolutely necessary.

All new parents registered with a GP will automatically be invited for their routine health visitor appointments.

Parents and carers, as well as young people, can continue to access the confidential secure text messaging service, ChatHealth.

The service operates Monday to Friday between 9am and 5pm, excluding bank holidays.

During these times, all texts will be responded to by a health visitor/school nurse within 24 hours.

Specific information and advice relating to COVID-19 has been added to all of Healthy Together’s public health websites: Health for Under 5s, Health for Kids (including the ‘Grown-ups’ section) and Health for Teens.

Clinical chairperson of East Leicestershire and Rutland CCG Dr Ursula Montgomery said: “I would like to thank patients in Leicester, Leicestershire and Rutland for their understanding and reassure them that GP practice teams are doing their best to provide GP services whilst protecting the most vulnerable patients.

“Practice teams are assessing every single person who contacts them to establish if a visit to the practice is required and our teams will continue to provide the safest advice and treatment.

“People can stay up to date with the latest advice by accessing their practice’s website or by accessing the NHS website and app. These sites provide more information and advice on how you can protect yourself and the NHS.”
• Order prescriptions online wherever possible. If you are unwell and need to collect a prescription, ask a friend or relative to collect it for you.
• Get NHS help online here.
• Download and use the NHS App to access NHS services using a smartphone or tablet.
• Use the NHS 111 online coronavirus service for advice on what to do if you have"

The fall in oil and gas prices, weak economic outlook, lowering LNG demand and supply glut have hit hard on the country’s LNG sector, says data and analytics company GlobalData.

“The unparalleled price crash had prompted LNG companies to reduce capex and defer financial investment decisions (FID) on their respective projects,” said Haseeb Ahmed, Oil and Gas Analyst at GlobalData.

“Woodside is contemplating to defer FID for its Pluto Train 2 by a year to 2021, which is likely to push the start year to 2025 from the previously expected 2024.”

Santos, a major Australian LNG exporter, has decided to reduce its spending by about $550m in 2020 due to the recent fall in oil prices and the resulting uncertainty in global economy.

The company is likely to delay FID of its Barossa gas project in Australia, which initially was expected to receive this year.

This may affect the expansion plans of Darwin LNG terminal, as Barossa project has been identified to provide gas to the terminal once it stops receiving gas from the Bayu-Undan field.

Also, due to COVID-19-induced LNG demand uncertainty, Western Gas Corporation is likely to delay its Equus Floating project.

Ahmed concluded, “Despite the landmark OPEC+ deal, oil prices are unlikely to exhibit immediate recovery, given the scale of demand destruction across the globe.”

“This effectively translates to the likelihood of LNG operators delaying discretionary expenditure, while having a unidirectional focus on improving operational efficiencies, which can further delay LNG projects.”"

See the pic here.,hollywoodlife.com,"Kim Kardashian had her fans seeing triple when she posted a look-alike Instagram pic that featured her, and her ‘favorite people’, mom Kris Jenner, and grandmother MJ, all posing in white outfits and platinum blonde hair.

Kim Kardashian, 39, was in a family mood on Apr. 22 when she took to Instagram to share a gorgeous photo of her, her mom Kris Jenner, 64, and her grandmother, Mary Jo “MJ” Shannon, 85, with much lighter locks than they’re usually showing off. The Keeping Up with the Kardashians star posted the snapshot, which showed all three of them posing in white tops and neutral colored pants while flaunting platinum blonde hair, which were most likely wigs, and she used the caption to dote on the ladies as well as tease her followers by telling them MJ has a secret social media account. “My favorite ladies. Fun fact my grandma has a creep IG account to see what were all up to,” the caption read.

It didn’t take long for Kim’s fans to comment on her pic and caption and most of them were positive and full of support. “Wow beautiful,” one wrote while another called the pic a “cuteness overload.” “Queens,” a third complimented and many others left heart emojis.

Although Kim didn’t say, her latest photo is most likely a throwback one since the family’s all been in quarantine and social distancing from each other due to the coronavirus pandemic. She’s been posting a lot of throwbacks of herself and her family members since the quarantine started and admitted to going through her phone and organizing photos when she shared an adorable pic of her youngest daughter Chicago, 2, on Apr. 21. The cutie was playing with blocks in the pic and looked enthralled as she placed them on top of each other. “The best thing I’ve been doing is organizing all of the pictures in my phone and making folders for each of my children,” Kim captioned the post.

Whether it’s of herself, her mom, her grandma, or her kids, we loving seeing Kim’as entertaining photos whenever we can and hope to see more throughout the quarantine."

In normal circumstances, deaths must be registered within 21 days. The Registration of Births and Deaths Act, 1969, stipulates a fine and intervention of the district magistrate in case of delays. The certificate is mandatory to proceed with insurance and financial transactions besides matters of property inheritance. 

Urban development minister Byrathi Basavaraj said no such issue had come up before him. “If any one approaches the government with such a problem, we will resolve it,” he said. 

The family of India’s first Covid-19 casualty — a 76-yearold preacher from Kalaburagi who died on March 10 — says they could apply only a week ago. “Properties are registered in his name. Normally, the first thing we do after the funeral is apply for the death certificate. Since the immediate family and most close relatives were in isolation, no one could apply,” said his son. High alert was declared in the district soon after the death and the ward where the victim stayed was declared a containment zone. 

The victim’s son is now frantically calling up health and corporation officials to secure the certificate, late as it is already. “I am worried that we will have to wait for the lockdown to lift. We need 

the certificate urgently to carry out financial transactions,” he said. The Gulbarga Institute Medical Sciences (GIMS), where the man died, has not issued a certificate which serves as a temporary document, he added. When contacted, GIMS director Kavita Patil refused comment, saying she could not reveal such information. 

After being contacted by TOI, Kalaburagi city corporation commissioner Rahul Pandve said he had accessed the GIMS death certificate of the victim and would take the matter ahead. “Though his son said he had applied a week ago, the application has not reached us. I have spoken to him and asked him to apply directly at the office. We will ensure the certificate is issued at the earliest,” Pandve said. “In general, there will be no delay in issuing death certificates,” he added, pointing out that daily requests had slumped by about 50% during the lockdown. 

The situation is similar for the family of an 80-year-old woman who died in Gadag on April 9. “All close family members are in isolation. How can we apply for the death certificate?” said a family member. He pointed out that when his father died, the local authorities had contacted him to register the death but not this time. “I think we have to wait for the lockdown to ease for the system to resume,” he said, resignedly. 

In Belagavi, a victim’s family from Hirebagewadi village — which is a cluster infection — hopes some exception will be made for them. The 80-year-old woman died on April 15. Village accountant Anil Kumar said he was preparing documents to generate the death certificate. “None of the family members turned up to apply as they are all under isolation. Hence, we have initiated the process, treating the case as an exception,” he said."

According to a report by the Globe and Mail, citing anonymous sources familiar with the situation at the Alberta Investment Management Corp., or AIMCo, the fund manager lost billions during the recent global economic collapse by betting on contracts that pay off only if stocks remain stable. AIMCo has since pulled the plug on volatile trading strategies, New-York based Institutional Investor reported Tuesday.

AIMCo controls $119 billion for 375,000 members of provincial public retirement programs and is responsible for the investments of 30 pension, endowment and government funds in Alberta, including the $18 billion Heritage Savings Trust Fund. The independent Crown corporation is set to take over the Alberta Teachers’ Retirement Fund (ATRF) in 2021 after changes made by the UCP government late last year.

In an emailed statement, Dénes Németh, director of corporate communication at AIMCo, said it would not comment on the performance of specific active investment strategies.

On Wednesday, Alberta government officials defended AIMCo’s investment record and transparency, and noted that institutional investors around the world have been experiencing difficult losses due to the pandemic.

“Things are so topsy turvy from day to day … it’s not surprising we would see investment funds of all scales and all places incurring losses right now,” said Premier Jason Kenney at the province’s COVID-19 update.

Kenney also defended the possibility of pulling Albertan’s pensions out of the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) — one recommendation the province’s Fair Deal Panel was mandated to report on.

“That is not about investment strategy, it is about demography,” he said, noting that Alberta has a young population and should be able to operate a public pension plan at lower premiums than the CPP.

Jerrica Goodwin, spokeswoman for Finance Minister Travis Toews, said in an emailed statement the “volatility-based investment program” behind AIMCo’s recent loss is not a new program and began well before the current UCP government took power.

The loss sparked concern from Alberta’s NDP Opposition Leader Rachel Notley, who said that if management decisions at AIMCo exacerbated risk, the situation deserves more scrutiny.

“This should be a clear message to Jason Kenney and Travis Toews to stop all talk of forcing Albertans to put their CPP into AIMCo, and stop all talks of forcing teachers to put their pension money into AIMCo,” said Notley.

Teachers’ pensions not part of AIMCo portfolio — yet

AIMCo’s hit did not affect the Alberta teachers’ pensions that have been at the centre of controversy since late last year.

But on Wednesday, the Alberta Teachers’ Association (ATA) reiterated its calls for the Alberta government to reverse its decision to transfer teacher pensions to AIMCo.

The UCP government passed a bill in November to move investment control of roughly $18 billion in assets to AIMCo from the Alberta Teachers’ Retirement Fund (ATRF) by December 2021. At the time, public sector unions protested the move and called it political interference. Public sector nominees to the governing board would require approval through a government order in council.

“It is completely unacceptable that investment managers would make such a significant investment without fully understanding the risks. I am confident that ATRF would not have invested in such a risky venture,” said Jason Schilling, ATA president, in a news release.

Kenney said the transfer will save taxpayers money and “generate better returns,” while continuing to allow the teachers’ board to manage its investment strategy and level of risk under AIMCo’s execution.

The Local Authorities Pension Plan (LAPP), for which AIMCo manages a $50-billion fund, issued a statement Wednesday acknowledging AIMCo sustained “significant losses” and to reassure its 275,000 members, including hospital, city and school employees and retirees who pay into the fund, that the plan “is strong enough to sustain investment losses.”

Chris Brown, president and CEO of LAPP, said in a release the defined benefit pension plan is “not threatened by short-term market fluctuations.”

On April 8, AIMCo announced its returns for 2019, a total fund return of 10.6 per cent representing approximately $11.5 billion in net investment income. The annualized total fund returns over 10 years were 8.2 per cent. By comparison, the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan delivered a 10.4 per cent return in 2019, and 9.8 per cent annualized over 10 years."

Los Angeles officials will start publicly documenting restaurants that have employees who tested positive for coronavirus.

The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health will begin posting a list of restaurants with confirmed coronavirus cases among its staff on its website, where it will reportedly be updating this list in real time. It is expected to go live “later this week,” L.A. County Department of Public Health director Dr. Barbara Ferrer said Tuesday, the Los Angeles Times reported.

It was not clear if the restaurants on the list will stay on the website indefinitely, or if they will be removed at some point.

Los Angeles County already currently monitors and posts lists of other public institutions, including nursing homes, jails, shelters and treatment centers, among others.

What would it mean if every registered voter was sent a ballot for the June 23 primary? Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo may be planning just that via executive order, NY1 reported Mon",www.newsday.com,"What would it mean if every registered voter was sent a ballot for the June 23 primary? Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo may be planning just that via executive order, NY1 reported Monday, and Cuomo spokesman Rich Azzopardi said this week that “we're looking at any and all possibilities"" regarding absentee voting.

The move would likely face a legal challenge. However, Long Island political operatives and candidates on both sides of the aisle are thinking through the implications anyway, saying it would be a chaotic whole new world.

“It will mean a lot of work for local Boards of Election to get that done,” wrote state and Nassau County Democratic Party leader Jay Jacobs in an email. “It MAY slow up the vote count. It WILL increase turn-out, but I am not sure just yet where.”

It would be a whole new situation for candidates struggling to get their message out. Some local politicos wonder what happens for campaigns without infrastructure or money to communicate to a large universe of voters.

Meanwhile, the GOP response to the absentee ballot idea has been largely negative.

State GOP chairman Nick Langworthy came out forcefully against automatic mailing of ballots, promising a legal challenge and warning about voter fraud barring “proper security measures.”

“There have been numerous cases across the country that should serve as a grave warning sign for the potential problems: ballot harvesting, ballots arriving late, ballots going to the wrong or old address, more than one ballot being delivered and bins of ballots that were never delivered,” he said in a statement.

Nassau GOP leader Joe Cairo echoed the party sentiment to The Point. “We want to make voting as easy as possible for everybody,” he said, but “I’m concerned about voter fraud.”

Can't we all just get along?

Back in February, Steve Israel picked today to launch the Cornell University Institute of Politics and Global Affairs’ new print and online publication dedicated to furthering bipartisanship.

The Bipartisan Policy Review went live less than 24 hours after Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell all but declared war on New York and other “blue states,” and Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi answered with a firestorm of her own. Even Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo got into the mix during his Thursday coronavirus news conference, saying of McConnell’s take: “This is one of the really dumb ideas of all time.” Cuomo added: “What he’s saying is … don’t help New York State because it is a Democratic state. How ugly a thought.”

The Bipartisan Policy Review is slated to publish twice a year, and every article must be co-authored by a Democrat and a Republican. Examples in this first issue, which features nine articles, include a piece on bail reform by Democratic Suffolk County Sheriff Errol Toulon and Republican Washington County Sheriff Jeffrey Murphy; an article on safeguarding elections by Washington state representatives Derek Kilmer, a Democrat, and Jaime Herrera Beutler, a Republican; and an article on the assertion of war powers in Congress by upstate GOP Rep. Tom Reed and New Jersey Democratic Rep. Josh Gottheimer.

In interviews on Fox News and Hugh Hewitt’s radio show Wednesday, McConnell railed against “blue state bailouts” and suggested states pummeled by the coronavirus epidemic should look to declare bankruptcy, as some beleaguered cities and counties have, rather than looking to the federal government for help. Later in the day, Pelosi said of McConnell’s attacks, “‘I’m not bailing out blue states, they should go bankrupt.’ Really? Really? How insecure is he in his own race in Kentucky to have to resort to that pathetic language?”

McConell faces former Marine Amy McGrath, who made waves when her $12.8 million raised in the first quarter of 2020 topped his haul by $5 million.

Thursday afternoon, Reed and Gottheimer, co-chairs of the House Problem Solvers Caucus, did a Zoom call with Israel to officially launch the journal just before its link went live.

Asked by The Point whether it was strange to have to come out battling for bipartisanship when his party’s leaders seem hellbent on destroying the state he represents, Reed said, “What I do as a member, I lead the way I believe … I applauded what [Senate Minority Leader Chuck] Schumer and Pelosi were able to get for New York ... I disagree with McConnell that bankruptcy is the best option for states, and I think if he is actually contemplating and telling Americans to get ready for state bankruptcies, it shows we have some very serious problems here that we are only going to be able to address if we come together as a country.”

Asked whether he thinks this bipartisan kick stands much chance of making progress, Israel said, “After 9/11, there was this universal consensus that Congress would get more bipartisan, and that lasted about one month. This pandemic has created about two months of bipartisanship so far, and I’m not sure it will last. But I know it needs to, if this nation is going to move forward, and so that’s what we are trying to work towards.”

The mail-drop game in the 1st Congressional District Democratic primary is ramping up.

Perry Gershon has been sending postcards about his town halls since the fall but a letter discussing the coronavirus pandemic hit mailboxes in early April.

The letter noted that Gershon was pausing in-person events, advertised a virtual town hall, and highlighted the coronavirus-related work of Long Islanders, including a lab finding “a way to 3D print safety equipment for medical personnel.”

Now Bridget Fleming is out with a letter of her own introducing herself and her work, and highlighting her government experience. The piece is headlined with “FROM THE DESK OF LEGISLATOR BRIDGET FLEMING” but is paid for by the campaign.

The letter discusses county-level issues from septic systems to groundwater, and mentions the work Fleming has done in office during the coronavirus, such as “introduced legislation to study the impact of this crisis on our small businesses that are hurting.”

The material went out Monday to tens of thousands and her campaign plans to send mail regularly down the stretch, according to a spokesman.

Fleming will also be out with a TV ad Friday, visible here, that introduces voters to her work in office in the past and during the pandemic.

Primary opponent Nancy Goroff hasn’t done mail yet, she says.

Mail may be an even more crucial part of campaigns this cycle given pandemic limitations on in-person voter contact in the field.

In the old world of say, a few months ago, Fleming’s campaign brought on a field expert, Mark Guarnaccia, as campaign manager.

Guarnaccia, 30, was field director in County Executive Steve Bellone’s successful 2019 re-election bid. In that race, “Brookhaven was a big focus of ours,” Guarnaccia says. The town is home to approximately a third of the county’s population and a key piece of the puzzle for any successful CD1 candidate.

The business of field operations has been entirely exploded by the coronavirus. But Fleming’s campaign argues that knowing the territory and utilizing relationships from previous campaigns will help in the new digital reality.

For Guarnaccia, that means a shift from Brookhaven door-knocking to virtual meet-and-greets and organizing voter calling.

Before the Bellone race, Guarnaccia, who is originally from Poughkeepsie, worked as field director for Liuba Grechen Shirley. In 2018, the outsider Democrat gave quite a scare to Rep. Pete King, the long-term incumbent not seeking reelection this cycle.

“Mark was an integral part of my campaign and I am so proud that he has stayed on Long Island and made a massive impact on our local politics,” said Grechen Shirley. “Mark is a natural organizer, leader, and political strategist and it has been a thrill to watch his career develop.”

Meanwhile, on the endorsement front

The pandemic hasn’t stopped the CD1 Democrats from rolling out big endorsements, including Goroff nabbing the nod from the National Organization for Women Political Action Committee on Thursday.

Fleming recently added to her list of local officials with the support of Southampton Town Supervisor Jay Schneiderman and Councilman John Bouvier.

And Gershon got the endorsement of the Brotherhood of Railroad Signalmen Local 56 and the New York State Public Employees Federation."
342,342,https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/another-surge-in-us-unemployment-applications-is-likely/2282546/,Gig Workers and Self-employed Keep Waiting for Jobless Aid,The number of Americans who have filed claims is already stunning: More than 4.4 million last week and 26 million in the five weeks since the coronavirus shut...,www.nbcwashington.com,"Like many Americans cooped up during the virus outbreak, Jeff Kardesch of Austin, Texas, is spending a lot of time on social media. It isn't just idle talk with friends. Kardesch is struggling to find out when he’ll receive the unemployment benefits he needs.

His business as a self-employed film and commercial producer evaporated once Austin canceled the annual South by Southwest festival in early March. Since then, no other work has replaced it.

Yet because Kardesch is self-employed, it's a headache for him to obtain unemployment aid — or even figure out when he will. A new federal relief package made freelancers like him eligible for unemployment benefitsfor the first time. But Texas, like most states, has had to establish a new system to process these new claims and distribute the money.

Kardesch, 23, applied in late March. He was quickly turned down. He has since reapplied. No luck.

“It’s really frustrating,” Kardesch said. “Nothing so far has really worked. The most I can do is just apply, get rejected and stay in the system.""

The number of Americans who have filed jobless claims is already stunning: More than 4.4 million last weekand 26 million in the five weeks since the coronavirus shut down much of the nation's economy. It's easily the worst stretch of job losses in U.S. history. Economists say the layoffs could send the unemployment rate as high as 20%, which would be the worst level since the Great Depression.

But there are many more filings for jobless aid to come, including millions of independent contractors, gig workers and the self-employed. Most states have not begun approving applications from these pools of newly eligible people.

The Labor Department estimates that 10.6 million Americans work as contractors, which means their jobs tend to exist for a limited period, and they receive few, if any, benefits. An additional 16 million are self-employed. And perhaps 1.5 million are gig workers — Uber drivers, TaskRabbit workers and the like — though most of these people do such work as a second job.

If even a quarter of them file for jobless aid, it would add up to many more new claims for unemployment, though it's hard to say how many. Kardesch and others who have already applied and been turned down wouldn't count as a new claim once Texas starts approving such applications.

The delay stems from the fact that statesalready have records for traditional workers that receive W-2 forms and whose employers pay unemployment taxes. But the process is more complicated for contractors and other independent workers who typically receive 1099s. State agencies need additional documentation, which their systems aren't set up to handle.

On Wednesday, the Texas Workforce Commission said it had begun to process claims from the self-employed and to reconsider applicants who were previously turned down. Other states aren't yet ready. Ohio says it won't be until mid-May. California says it will start accepting applications next week. Pennsylvania and Massachusetts have only recently begun doing so.

Some experts expect more self-employed people to apply in coming weeks after failing to obtain a loan through the government's small business lending program, which ran out of money late Thursday. Congress is moving toward replenishing those funds. But banks say that amount will also soon be exhausted.

“We have been pretty much hearing non-stop from people,"" including anxious self-employed workers, said Julia Simon-Mishel, a lawyer with Philadelphia Legal Assistance. More contractors and self-employed have been participating in her Facebook Live seminars on jobless aid. The most recent seminar was viewed 7,500 times.

“They were looking for those (small business) loans, and now pandemic unemployment system is their only option,"" she said, referring to the expanded federal program.

Yet many gig workers will find that their extra income from side hustles won't help them if they have a regular job.

Wes Little, a drummer in Nashville, has made only about 5% of his income through traditional jobs. Even so, Tennessee, like all states, required him to file under its traditional unemployment system. That means his benefits are pegged only to his income from traditional work — not to his larger pay from music gigs. Laid-off workers can't receive benefits from both regular unemployment and the pandemic program.

He received $69 the first week and $54 the second week. He is, however, able to receive the additional $600 a week in federally provided jobless aid that Congress recently approved.

The number of people who are receiving unemployment benefits has reached a record 16 million, surpassing a previous high of 12 million set in 2010, just after the 2008-2009 recession ended. This figure reflects people who have managed to navigate the application systems in their states, have been approved for benefits and are actually receiving checks.

Women make up a majority of workers in some industries that have been hit hardest, such as health care, where many jobs outside hospitals have been lost, and hotels and restaurants. Heidi Shierholz, an economist at the progressive Economic Policy Institute, calculates that 56% of the layoffs have involved women.

African-Americans and Latinos are typically among the first to be laid off in recessions. Though the government doesn't track the jobless claims data by gender or race, a survey by the University of Southern California found that 21% of African Americans and 18% of Latinos say they have lost jobs in the past month, compared with 15% of whites.

One factor in that disparity is the ability to work from home. A study by the Center for American Progress found that whites are more than twice as likely as blacks to say they can work from home and 50% more likely than Latinos.

In Michigan, 17% of the state's workforce is now receiving unemployment aid, the largest proportion in the country. It is followed by Rhode Island at 15%, Nevada at 13.7% and Georgia at 13.6%.

In the meantime, the self-employed keep waiting. Among them is Sasha McVeigh, a musician in Nashville. She had been working steadily until the city shut down music clubs in mid-March.

Since then, she’s applied for unemployment benefits but so far has received nothing. To make ends meet, McVeigh has applied for some grants available to out-of-work musicians, held some live streaming concerts and pushed her merchandise sales. Still, she worries about what's ahead.

""It has been nagging on my mind — what if my unemployment doesn’t come in or it keeps being delayed? What am I going to do? But if you keep focusing on that terrifying thought, it becomes impossible to function.”

Meanwhile, 936 new cases have been confirmed taking the national total to 17,607.

It comes after three cases were de-notified because officials found they were unrelated to the virus.

Announcing the new cases, The Chief Medical Officer Dr Tony Holohan reminded the public that officials are carrying out an “ambitious programme of testing in nursing homes and community residential facilities.”

Last night, Dr Holohan said he was “very concerned” about the prospect of people easing up in following the restrictions that are in place and this evening, he displayed two graphs suggesting people are moving around more.

The first, from the Irish National Seismic Network, showed data from an instrument used to measure earthquake activity that also picks up the movement of people and traffic.

The second displayed Apple Mobility Data, which also measures activity on the country’s roadways.

Both showed a sharp drop in activity since the restrictions were put in place; however, they also show an increase in activity in recent days.

“This is giving us hard evidence that there is more population movement in spite of our continuing advice and gives us an evidential basis for some of the concerns we have been expressing,” said Dr Holohan.

“People are moving out and about more than they were – even though our recommendations and public health advice have not changed.”

Earlier, the Minister for Health Simon Harris said the growth rate of the virus had fallen to between 0.5 and 1 and urged people to “stay the course” over the coming days.

Professor Philip Nolan, Chair of NPHET Epidemiological Modelling Advisory Group, said: “For the population at large, the growth rate is at zero and the transmission of the virus is effectively suppressed.

“Our R number is between 0.5 and 0.8. This success emphasises how vital it is to remain vigilant in our behaviours. If the R number moves above one, we are no longer in control of the disease.”

Of the deaths recorded so far, 392 occurred in a hospital (49%) and 50 happened in intensive care (6.3%)

He said 672 (85%) of the patients that died were living with underlying health conditions.

Some 53% of them were male and 47% were female.

The average age of the dead is 81-years-old.

There are now clusters of infections in 319 community residential facilities, 191 of which are nursing homes.

The are 2,960 confirmed cases in care homes including 2,231 in nursing homes.

There have been 433 confirmed deaths associated with care homes – 103 of which happened in hospital.

By Midnight on Tuesday, some 2,424 of the country’s 16,439 patients had been admitted to hospital with their symptoms.

Meanwhile, 331 had been admitted to intensive care.

Some 27.6% were healthcare workers and 57% were women.

Of the 332 patients taken to intensive care, 142 (43%) remain in the ICU and 139 (42%) have been discharged.

Some 84% had been living with underlying health conditions.

It comes as the Taoiseach warned that any easing of the virus restrictions will come in gradual steps.

Speaking in the Dáil, Leo Varadkar said complacency is “our new enemy” in the battle to contain the outbreak.

He said the National Public Health Emergency Team has set out four criteria for consideration before easing restrictions
• The level of transmission, including in residential care homes
• The number of patients in intensive care

Reports this morning indicated that the ban on essential travel may be modified after May 5th, with people permitted to go further than the 2km radius.

Meanwhile, older people may be allowed to venture out for exercise."

Health officials said Wednesday that 767 people have now lived at least 30 days since initial infection, and are presumed recovered. The death toll rose to 54 on Wednesday from 48 on Monday.

All of the deaths have been in western and central Idaho.

At the moment, 162 cases have required hospitalization, and most of those patients have or are expected to recover, according to state health officials.

Sixty-four cases are now reported in eastern Idaho, according to Eastern Idaho Public Health District and Southeast Idaho Public Health District. However, a significant number of these cases are among those who have lived past 30 days.

The number of COVID-19 tests available in Idaho continues to grow daily. However, public health officials continue to warn that due to initial testing limitations, the actual number of coronavirus cases may be much higher than is being reported.

EIPH says it’s more important than ever to follow the recommendations and directions of federal, state and local health officials, including the following:
• Following the stay-home order, which was announced by Gov. Brad Little on March 25 and was extended through April 30. A copy of the order can be found at www.EIPH.Idaho.gov.
• Practicing social-distancing (maintaining at least 6 feet between individuals), avoiding crowds of any number, and eliminating all non-essential travel, as detailed in the order.
• Staying home when sick even if your symptoms are mild. A symptom-monitoring checklist and decision tree was recently developed to help individuals and employers determine what they should do if they are experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 or have been primarily or secondarily exposed to a person with COVID-19 symptoms. A copy of these documents can be found at www.EIPH.Idaho.gov. This monitoring tool can be used daily by everyone to assess their health during this pandemic.
• Covering your coughs and sneezes with a tissue, avoiding touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands, cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched objects and surfaces, washing hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, using hand sanitizer, and avoiding close contact with people who are sick.
• People with an increased risk of severe illness (older adults and those with underlying health conditions) should take extra precautions to avoid exposure to COVID-19.

For questions, guidance, and information about COVID-19, visit EIPH’s website at www.EIPH.Idaho.gov or call the hotline number at (208) 522-0310 or (855) 533-3160 (toll free). The hotline is active Monday to Friday, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.

347,347,https://nypost.com/2020/04/22/anchors-take-viewers-behind-the-scenes-of-their-home-broadcasts/,Coronavirus allows anchors to let viewers into their homes,"TV presenters on NBC, Fox, CNBC, CBS and NY1 show the public their most private space, possessions and even loved ones.",nypost.com,"Broadcast news anchors weathering the coronavirus storm from the confines of their apartments or houses have no choice but to offer peeks into their personal spaces during their broadcasts.

Read on for what five New York-area anchors have to say about lifting the curtain to their living rooms, and beyond.

For the past several weeks, Snapchat users have noticed Savannah Sellers — the host of NBC’s “Stay Tuned,” the daily news show that appears on that mobile platform — seated in a temporary, yet cozy, studio. It’s the two-bedroom apartment in the East Village that she shares with her boyfriend, investment analyst Alex Yaraghi.

As seen in her broadcasts, her perch features a stacked bookcase and an exposed brick wall leading to an open kitchen where she keeps fresh flowers on the counter.

“I’m lucky that the grocery store I go to carries them and continues to have them,” the 28-year-old Sellers, who’s also a correspondent for NBC News and MSNBC, says of the blooms, which include white roses. “[They] brighten it up a bit.”

Most of all, even in the small frame, Sellers’ viewers are getting a peek into her life.

“It’s nice to show me as a whole person and a personality that can’t come out in a studio just reading the news,” she says.

On the bookshelf, for instance, her viewers can see a ceramic dog — which isn’t just a small keepsake. Sellers’ grandmother, who recently died after battling Alzheimer’s, painted it for her. There are also hand-poured candles from Rome, where she studied abroad and says “is my favorite city other than New York.”

“It felt nice to have a little piece of Italy, where I was supposed to be going in a couple weeks,” she adds. “They remind me of what Italy’s going through,” in terms of that nation’s own battle with the coronavirus, and “what we’re all going through.”

As for the books, Sellers is happy to show titles by her friends at work, like Katy Tur’s “Unbelievable: My Front-Row Seat to the Craziest Campaign in American History” and Steve Kornacki’s “The Red and the Blue: The 1990s and the Birth of Political Tribalism.”

The social-media response from her followers has been positive. A March Instagram upload showing off this corner of her apartment — with comments including “Obsessed with your space!” and “Love how the books are color-coordinated!” — helped connect her with her audience. And that comes at a time when many, in an effort to curb the spread of COVID-19, are also at home.

“It makes you feel like we’re all dealing with this together,” she says. “I think it’s nice we’re in solidarity.”

Though she sits in front of a screen for her weekday broadcasts, Dana Perino — the anchor of Fox News Channel’s “The Daily Briefing” and co-host of “The Five” — is surrounded by familiar comforts. Working from her five-bedroom beach home in Bay Head, NJ, the biggest one is her dog Jasper, an 8-year-old Hungarian Vizsla, who’s known to make the occasional broadcast appearance.

“He’ll look right in the camera,” she says.

But recently, while Perino hosted “Storytime with Dana” — an online weekday program in which she reads books for children and their families — Jasper came close to causing a scene.

“I didn’t have him on set with me,” says the 47-year-old former White House press secretary, but he was “sniffing under the bed and getting close to some wires,” she adds of Jasper’s precarious trek. Luckily, nothing came crashing down.

Generally, while Perino broadcasts from the guest bedroom, her husband Peter McMahon will keep the pooch downstairs, or her assistant will keep him in another room.

“He’s really quiet,” says Perino, and that’s in large part thanks to McMahon taking Jasper for long walks to give him exercise.

Elsewhere in the home — which is adorned with blue and coral tones, as well as white linens on the beds — Perino will prepare for her segments while standing at her kitchen island. The home also features a porch where Jasper likes to sit and a game table in her living room where Perino solves puzzles with her husband while listening to music playing on vintage stereo equipment.

“It’s a comfortable place to be,” she says, but she admits she’ll welcome reality when she returns to the studio. “I will be glad once we’re back for sure.”

On his second day of working from home — feeling weighed down by the “grim” tone of coronavirus-related coverage — CNBC stocks correspondent Bob Pisani had a simple thought for improving the general mood.

“I decided to use my posters as a backdrop to provide a little color and lightness to balance the steady stream of bad news,” says the 64-year-old.

By posters, he means an array of vibrant, and original, rock concert posters that he’s collected for more than 30 years. His rotating display includes everything from Jimi Hendrix to Soundgarden, and from the Grateful Dead to Duran Duran, that appear behind him when he shoots from his home’s second-floor study — 90 miles from where he shoots at the New York Stock Exchange.

“The Twitter traffic just exploded — I was very surprised at how interested people were,” says Pisani of the feedback he quickly received from viewers. “I think people are interested in a bit of a distraction from all the news and watching … what’s behind [newscasters] and how it may reveal a little bit of their personality.”

“A little bit” being the operative phrase, as Pisani declines to say where he lives. “Like most financial reporters, I’m fairly private and usually stick to reporting the news,” he says.

Other than journalism, music is Pisani’s other great love — having seen Bob Dylan, the Grateful Dead and the Grand Funk Railroad. “It just always made me feel good,” he says, and it’s no surprise the passion also bleeds into acquiring posters — which he’ll do, in part, at conventions each fall in San Francisco. His knowledge of their history is encyclopedic, especially of posters from the 1960s and the artistic styles behind them.

“I think these artists are like the Toulouse-Lautrecs of their age,” he says of the French artist whose posters famously captured the essence of 1890s Paris. “These artists were active in the 1960s and invented Psychedelia, which had a profound impact on the visual style of the 1960s.”

“If I’m not afraid to show it to a visitor, then I’m generally not afraid to show it to our viewers,” says CBS’ Vladimir Duthiers of his Upper West Side two-bedroom. But within his first few days of broadcasting from this perch, which the 50-year-old shares with his fiancee Marian Wang, a senior news producer at “Last Week Tonight with John Oliver,” Wang requested that a small photo of Michelangelo’s nude “David” sculpture be removed from their refrigerator door.

“‘Maybe we don’t want that photo [there],’ ” Duthiers — a “CBS This Morning” and CBS News correspondent, and a CBSN anchor — recalls her saying, adding that a full-frontal nude shouldn’t appear on air. “‘It’s a morning show after all.’ ”

Still, Duthiers says he opts to broadcast his segments from various locations in the apartment as a way to connect with his audience.

“I was a viewer and consumer of news all my life,” he says. “I do have a sense of what it’s like to watch Anderson Cooper … and think ‘maybe he likes the same books that I like,’ or ‘maybe he’s interested in the same hobbies I am.’ You want to have a connection with the person you’re consuming media from.”

So, when shooting in his living room, he’ll sometimes sit with several electric guitars and a bookcase stacked with tomes behind him — all of which have meaning. The apple-red Gretsch Electromatic, for instance, is the very first guitar he purchased about 16 years ago when he became serious about playing after initially starting at age 15. But his books hold a deeper love in his heart. Among those kept in that shelving unit, which he says is a fraction of his collection, are “D’Aulaires’ Book of Greek Myths” that he’s had since childhood.

“Wherever I go, wherever I move, I always take them with me,” he says, adding that, while moving around a lot as a child, they were a constant — and, with regards to his collection of biographies (like those on Eleanor Roosevelt and Muhammad Ali), his inspiration to become a journalist. “They’re really a big part of my life.”

Other shooting angles show pieces of art he bought in South Africa from artist Ezequiel Mabote — and, beyond reaching out to Duthiers to comment on his guitars and book collection — viewers have reached out to get the creator’s name.

“He’s probably selling a lot of art right now,” Duthiers quips.

The general dialogue with viewers keeps Duthiers going.

“There’s a connection you make with somebody without having spoken to that person,” he says. “It goes beyond the reporting you’re doing on air — it’s something visceral and human.”

NY1’s Jamie Stelter holds the phone up to her nearly 3-year-old daughter Sunny and asks where the 38-year-old traffic reporter and “Mornings on 1” co-host has been working lately.

“It’s Bubby’s room,” says Sunny, of Stelter’s third bedroom where she and her husband, CNN anchor Brian Stelter, have her parents stay when they visit their Columbus Circle apartment.

Now, it’s a television studio. For her broadcasts, Stelter sits in front of a screen inside that shows the New York City skyline — but viewers can still get the occasional peek of Stelter’s family life on their televisions. She’s had the kids come on air a couple Fridays in a row.

“It’s not a secret that I have two tiny children who are at home with me,” she says. “I love that they came on camera, I’m sure they’ll appear more when it’s appropriate. There’s a line also … just in terms of work/life separation.”

Still, a silver lining is that working from home has led to more family time. After her on-air hits, Stelter walks out of the room to make French toast for Sunny, to puree food for her infant son Story — and to change dirty diapers.

“I’m doing all kinds of mom things that I would do on the weekends, and now it’s a seven-day-a-week thing,” says Stelter. “We’re falling into … rhythms with it now.”

At first, she explained to the kids she’d have to stay in the spare bedroom to do work, but that she’d be back soon. (Brian stays with them during her broadcasts.)

Now, she says, “There’s a little more understanding of this is what goes on.”

Even Brian, who sets up Stelter’s at-home anchor kit at 5 each morning, has had to adjust. Stelter says he’d previously straggle into the room half-asleep — but it’s been easier for him lately to set up her lights and camera.

“He’s not a morning person, and that’s okay,” she says."

Other beneficiaries included the federal government, local governments and other agencies.

The distributed amount comprised Statutory Revenue, Value Added Tax (VAT), and Exchange Gain, according to a communique issued by the committee.

Unlike in previous occasions when the amount shared was calculated based on the official exchange rate of N305 to $1, the sum distributed yesterday among the beneficiaries was arrived at based on the adjusted exchange rate of N360 to a dollar.

The Forum of Commissioners for Finance had last week announced that due to the current lockdown occasioned by COVID-19 pandemic, the monthly FAAC meetings usually held in Abuja would hold via virtual conferencing, to share the March allocation.

Giving further details of the March revenue, the communique said the gross statutory revenue for the month at N597.676 billion, was higher than the N466.058 billion received in February by N131.618 billion.

Value Added Tax (VAT) also yielded a gross revenue of N120.268 billion in March as against N99.552 billion in February, an increase of N20.716 billion.

A total of N62.928 billion was available from exchange gain in the month under review.

 From the total revenue of N780.926 billion, the federal government received N264.330 billion, states– N181.487 billion and the local governments received N135.950 billion.

Oil producing states received N38.751 billion as 13 per cent derivation revenue, while the cost of revenue collection by revenue agencies and allocation to the North East Development Agency (NEDC) was N160.408 billion.

According to the communique, the federal government received N217.773 billion from the gross statutory revenue of N597.676 billion, states got N110.457 billion and local government councils received N85.158 billion.

The sum of N32.299 billion was given to oil-producing states as 13 per cent derivation revenue while cost of revenue collection agencies and NEDC got N151.989 billion.

Giving further breakdown, the communique stated that the federal government received N16.777 billion from VAT revenue of N120.268 billion, states received N55.925 billion, local government councils got N39.147 billion, while the cost of collection by revenue agencies and allocation to NEDC was N8.419 billion.

However, from exchange gain, the federal government received N29.780 billion, states–N15.105 billion, local government councils received N11.645 billion while oil producing states received N6.452 billion from the total revenue of N62.982 billion available.

Petroleum Profit Tax (PPT), Companies Income Tax(CIT), Import and Excise Duties, Oil and Gas Royalties and Value Added Tax (VAT) all recorded substantial increases during the month under review.

351,351,https://theconversation.com/running-shoes-may-cause-injuries-going-barefoot-could-be-the-surprising-fix-135264,Running shoes may cause injuries – but is going barefoot the fix?,"Running as nature intended might help prevent shin, foot, knee and ankle injuries.",theconversation.com,"It was around four to six million years ago when humans first evolved to walk upright. We continued to evolve into superb long-distance walkers and runners, made possible by our arched feet, long achilles tendon, and ability to cool through sweating. And surprisingly, for most of human history this long distance travel was done barefoot.

Some evidence suggests footwear emerged around 30,000 years ago. But it wasn’t until about 100 years ago that fashionable footwear was reported to be altering the shape of the foot. Since the 1970s, cushioned running shoes have become synonymous with exercise.

But a growing body of evidence shows running shoes might actually be doing us more harm than good. Our latest review suggests that wearing shoes changes the way we run and weakens the foot in a way that can contribute to many common sports injuries.

Previously, our team revealed that we can still run barefoot, especially if we start young. We found that not only could children in New Zealand aged 12-19 run sprint and middle-distance races barefoot, we also found the prevalence of pain in the lower limbs (knees, ankles, and feet) was relatively low compared with children of similar ages from other countries. Other research has also shown differences in foot structure and function in barefoot and shoe-wearing populations.

These findings prompted us to conduct a global review of running injuries in men and women. We found that between 35 and 50% of runners were injured at any one time. These numbers could be considered high – especially for a species adapted to long-distance running. The most common injuries were to the knees, shins, ankles and feet. Most of these injuries were mainly to bone or connective tissue, whose primary function is to help transmit force from the muscles to allow movement.

Our latest review explored how humans ran before using shoes, and how shoes change the way we run. We found that when the foot comes into contact with the ground, the skin, ligaments, tendons and nerves of the foot feed a rich source of information to the brain and spinal cord about the exact position of our foot, including tension, stretch and pressure. The quality of this information allows the precise control of muscles to move our joints into a position that absorbs impact and limits damage.

The first mass-marketed cushioned running shoe was manufactured in the 1970s and advertised as footwear that could prevent running injuries. Surprisingly, this narrative even found its way into the scientific literature. In the 1980s, “better running shoes” were suggested as a reason for the reduced incidence of Achilles tendinopathy in one study and “poor shoes” were suggested as a risk factor for stress fractures in another study.

Our review suggests that footwear reduces the quality of information being sent to the brain and spinal cord, leading to more blunt running mechanics. Shoes allow runners to land with a more upright body position and an extended leg, leading to excessive braking forces. These running mechanics seem to play a role in some of the most common running injuries.

Long-term everyday use of footwear also leads to a weaker foot and often, a collapsed arch. When we start running in shoes, our foot isn’t adapted to cope with these mechanics.

But this damage might be reversible. Interestingly, one study found that foot muscle size and strength were found to increase after eight weeks of walking in a minimalist shoe. This is because removing the cushioned heel and arch support made the foot’s muscle work harder.

Balance activities are also recommended to improve proprioception, which is our awareness of our body’s position and movements. This type of training aims to prevent or repair injuries. Using equipment like a wobble board will create more unstable or less predictable conditions under foot, which builds lower limb stability and foot strength.

But the simplest and perhaps most specific form of proprioceptive training for runners is to take off their shoes and walk or run. In fact, barefoot runners appear to report fewer knee injuries and less heel pain compared to runners who use shoes.

However, barefoot runners do report more calf and achilles tendon injuries. This suggests that people who transition too quickly to barefoot activities may overload their muscles and tendons. This might be because barefoot runners usually have a shorter stride and more flexed hip, knee and ankle. They also tend to run more on the tip of their toes.

Although ditching your running shoes might not work for everyone, if you want to give barefoot running a try, the best advice is to walk before you run. A minimalist shoe might be a good first step if walking or running in extreme temperatures or where sharp objects may be common. Although minimalist shoes aren’t the same as being barefoot, the mechanics runners and walkers use in them are very similar to when barefoot – and dramatically different to when in shoes.

Running injuries are caused by many factors, such as age, previous injuries, body mass index, and sudden changes in training volume – so shoes might not be wholly to blame. And while shoes are relatively new to our species, so are our sedentary lifestyles.

It’s likely that these factors might also make humans less conditioned to move how they did millions of years ago. This suggests a combination of getting more active, walking or running barefoot more often, and other conditioning exercises may help prevent further injuries in the future."
352,352,https://fas.org/blogs/secrecy/2020/04/military-covid19/,The Military Role in Combating COVID-19,,fas.org,"There is a bewildering amount of official guidance on the role of the military in circumstances such as the current pandemic. But the practical impact of that guidance, whatever it may be, is unclear. Like the proverbial war plan that cannot survive first contact with the enemy, Pentagon doctrine on infectious disease seems to have been overtaken by events.

“The mission of DOD in a pandemic is to preserve U.S. combat capabilities and readiness and to support U.S. government efforts to save lives, reduce human suffering, and slow the spread of infection,” according to a 2019 Army manual.

To help accomplish that, another military manual offered a “prioritized and tiered [list of] infectious diseases [to] assist the military research community in focusing on the development of vaccine, prophylactic drugs, diagnostic capabilities, and surveillance efforts.”

Pandemic influenza was among the highest priority diseases, posing a “high operational risk,” but unfortunately the intended military research response appears to have lagged.

Who is in charge?

Well, “USNORTHCOM [US Northern Command] exercises coordinating authority for planning of DOD efforts in support of the USG response to pandemic influenza and infectious disease,” says a Pentagon publication (JP 3-40) on Joint Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction.

What is NORTHCOM doing?

“DoD has nearly 11,000 personnel dedicated to COVID-19 operations nation-wide, with nearly 2,500 in the New York City area,” according to an April 10 news release. “DOD is providing expeditionary medical care in several states across the country.”

“NORTHCOM is out there working furiously to carry out its many missions, implementing at least five different operations plans simultaneously,” according to military researcher William M. Arkin.

But “Implementing might be too strong of a word,” he wrote, “because even though these plans run in the hundreds of pages, most are thrown out the window almost as soon as they are taken off the shelf, useful in laying out how things should be organized but otherwise too rigid — or fanciful — to apply to the real world.”

In a new piece, Arkin surveyed 19 operational military plans that in theory govern NORTHCOM activities. Most of them are not publicly available, and some are classified.

“Is there any reason you can imagine that the pandemic response plan shouldn’t be public? Or the plan for Defense Support of Civil Authorities?” Arkin doesn’t think so.

One of the plans he turned up, a 2017 NORTHCOM draft on Pandemic Influenza and Infectious Disease Response, identified what it termed “critical vulnerabilities” including:

“Lack of communication and synchronization among partners and stakeholders, inability or unwillingness to share information / biosurveillance data, limited detection capabilities, and limited laboratory confirmatory testing.”

That particular plan from 2017 “seemingly never went beyond the draft stage,” said Arkin."

At the end of The Whole Picture: The colonial story of the art in our museums and why we need to talk about it, Alice Procter quotes from author Ursula R Le Guin:

‘Past events exist, after all, only in memory, which is a form of imagination. The event is real now, but once it’s then, it’s continuing reality is entirely up to us, depending on our energy and honesty.’

We are left with the thought that we can be active participants in the way we understand, interpret and remember our stories as individuals, institutions and communities: Regardless of whether these stories be housed in the ornate spaces of the past or contemporary spaces of steel and concrete we can question, object or disrupt the accepted narratives.

Beginning with a series of prompts, such as ‘What makes a museum?’ ‘What are you looking at inside?’ ‘What does the museum feel like?’ Procter then takes us on an ‘uncomfortable tour’ through the gallery spaces of Western history; spaces often motivated by cultural conditioning and influenced by wealth and power. But she also brings to our attention the power of artists and the general public to rewrite this narrative.

Divided into four chronological sections: The Palace, The Classroom, The Memorial and The Playground, Procter examines the motivations behind and reactions to a range of museums, galleries and memorials; the histories around these examples sometimes fascinating and often shocking.

Products of the European enlightenment, museums began in royal residences or aristocratic homes such as the Louvre, Prado and the Hermitage, becoming the prototypes for collections which followed. Appropriation of antiquity was common in the 18th and 19th centuries; the Elgin Marbles, sculptural reliefs taken by Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin in 1803 from their original setting on the Parthenon and other Acropolis temples in Athens and ending up in the British Museum are examples of this. Ongoing battles for the return of these pieces along with many other objects have become long term issues between institutions and governments, calling for repatriation or restitution of past wrongs.

Pitt’s diamond, now housed in the Louvre, is an example of the integration of colonial power, synonymous with the East India Company of the 18th century, and the wealth and power of governments and institutions. Bought in India and incorporated into the French crown jewels it later became part of Napoleon’s sword hilt.

Marina Abramovic, a contemporary performance artist plays with this idea of reverence of association. In her title work The Artist is Present, 2010, at the MoMA retrospective, she spent every day during the exhibition in its atrium sitting under harsh flood lights where a visitor could sit opposite and experience her presence. Every visitor was photographed, with images posted online. Documentaries and a mocumentory were made, along with a novel, keeping her performance alive in popular consciousness.

Ways contemporary artists are reframing and interpreting the stories of these objects or artworks in museums is something that Procter regularly brings to our attention. The exhibition Mining the Museum, by Fred Wilson, 1992 has been a pivotal influence in the rethinking of other museum spaces and the objects on display; through the use of greater interpretive material, changes to labelling, renaming of objects, juxtaposing of narratives and so on, a different story is told. Staged at the Maryland Historical Society (MdHS), Wilson, an African American artist and activist, rearranged the space to represent stories of marginalised groups such as Native North Americans and African Americans. Over a few months the museum was rearranged to represent stories of discrimination, racism and enslavement. The exhibition confronted the viewer, asking difficult questions about how to interact with existing historical narratives.

The contemplation room, the final resting place for visitors to the Museum of African American History and Culture (NMAAHC) is a good place to finish as it is a quiet space. Somewhere to sit and consider the stories that have been told through object, photographs, artworks and text. Thirteen years in the making, the museum opened in 2016 and focuses not just on the ideology of remembrance but a way forward; presenting a timeline of American history to the present day. The contemplation room is a space with no answers, just gently running water and time for reflection.

A beautifully written and carefully researched book, Procter, a historian of material culture and the creator of Uncomfortable Art Tours, encourages the reader to think more critically and challenge the institutionalised paradigms of power and privilege in our museums and art galleries to instigate change.

A powerful and insightful exploration into the stories of our cultural heritage.

HOLYOKE — As the state Department of Public Health starts to release more data about the COVID-19 pandemic, including more detailed reports of cases in nursing homes, Holyoke Mayor Alex Morse is calling for state leaders to step in and take emergency operational control of all long-term care facilities with positive cases of the coronavirus in Massachusetts.

In a statement Tuesday, Morse called for state intervention at long-term care facilities in his city and across the state, arguing that regardless of ownership structure, they “have proven unprepared to deal with the veracity of this pandemic.” The state’s data on these facilities, he said, “is alarming, but to the best of our local knowledge, it is an undercounting of the true nature of the spread of this virus in these facilities.”

“In partnership with our local Board of Health and our Emergency Management Team, I am calling for immediate state intervention at Holyoke long-term care facilities with positive COVID-19 cases, and for the state to implement a plan for direct emergency operational control or physical oversight of all long-term care facilities with positive cases in Massachusetts,” Morse said.

According to DPH data released Tuesday, there are five nursing homes, rest homes or skilled nursing facilities in Holyoke that have two or more cases of COVID-19, the threshold the agency is using to report such data. The data doesn’t differentiate between residents and staff and doesn’t include assisted living residences. There are also two facilities with COVID-19 cases in Northampton, according to the DPH’s data. No other facilities in Hampshire County were listed in the state’s data.

The Soldiers’ Home has the most reported and confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Holyoke; as of Tuesday 93 veteran residents have been diagnosed with the infectious disease and 55 have died from it.

As of Tuesday, Day Brook Village Senior Living’s skilled nursing center at 298 Jarvis Ave. in Holyoke had 26 residents who tested positive for COVID-19 as well as two deaths, according to Lisa Gaudet, vice president of communications at Berkshire Healthcare. All of these cases, with the exception of two, were in the nursing home’s dementia special care unit, which Gaudet said makes it more challenging to help folks with cognitive or memory issues follow social distancing and other rules.

The facility has 92 licensed beds, according to DPH. In Tuesday’s report, DPH reported the number of confirmed cases at less than 10, far fewer than the numbers provided by Gaudet.

Mount St. Vincent Nursing Home, at 35 Holy Family Road in Holyoke, has 10-30 known cases of COVID-19 in its facility with 125 total beds, according to the DPH data. Christine Looby, spokeswomanfor Trinity Health of New England Senior Communities, said Wednesday she could not release more concrete numbers, but that more specific data is given to the DPH on a daily basis.

“Regardless of their status of COVID-19, we are considering everyone as if they are in isolation,” Looby said.

Nine residents have tested positive for COVID-19 and one has died from the disease at Mont Marie Rehabilitation & Healthcare Center at 36 Lower Westfield Road in Holyoke, according to a statement provided to the Gazette by Lisa Rivard-Chopak, administrator of the nursing home. Four employees have also tested positive for the disease and are in self-quarantine, she said. The facility has 84 licensed beds, according to DPH data.

“Our staff at Mont Marie Rehabilitation & Healthcare Center is working incredibly hard at infection control and keeping residents safe,” Rivard-Chopak said. “We are following all CDC and state guidelines, including placing residents who have been exposed in quarantine and those who have tested positive in isolation.”

Lastly, CareOne at Holyoke, at 260 Easthampton Road, has reported fewer than 10 known cases of COVID-19 to the state at its 164-bed facility, according to DPH data.

At CareOne at Northampton, 548 Elm St., however, DPH figures show more than 30 cases of COVID-19 at its 125-bed facility.

In a statement, CareOne declined to release more information on those infected with COVID-19 at either its Holyoke or Northampton facilities, saying that “many continue to recover and the condition of these individuals changes each day, so a cumulative tally cannot accurately represent our current reality.”

“CareOne’s mission continues to focus on protecting our employees, residents, and communities.

“CareOne residents are not statistics. These are real people who have become a part of our family,” the statement read. “We communicate directly with residents, families, and employees, every day and will continue to do so. Families also have around-the-clock access to a hotline for information.

“Amid an incredibly challenging and rapidly changing environment, it’s not reasonable or prudent for our team to divert resources away from caring for our residents — our primary and most important task — to respond to inquiries from the public,” it continued.

At Highview of Northampton, 222 River Road in Leeds, three residents have tested positive for COVID-19, according to a statement released Tuesday.

As of Wednesday, there are no other tests outstanding and no workers have tested positive, said Tim Brown, a spokesman for Athena Health Care Systems.

Holyoke HealthCare Center had been placed on Tuesday’s DPH list incorrectly, according to a spokesperson for the facility.

Holyoke Director of Health Sean Gonsalves wrote in an email Wednesday that the city’s board of health monitors communicable diseases through a statewide portal hosted by the state DPH called the Massachusetts Virtual Epidemiologic Network (MAVEN).

Upon receipt of a positive COVID-19 case, the DPH reports these cases to the Holyoke board of health through MAVEN and the city’s public health officials then call the infected individual, or their nurse/caretaker if the person is incapacitated, for an “interview,” Gonsalves said. These interviews can reveal pertinent information such as personal demographics, possible disease transmission points as well as close contacts who are subsequently notified, he said.

The process is largely the same for long-term care facilities, Gonsalves said, though those interviews are usually done through nurses.

“We try and communicate with nursing homes and long-term care facilities (that have positive cases) on a daily basis, but that can be challenging for these facilities when dealing with a communicable disease outbreak,” Gonsalves said. “MDPH and the Board of Health regularly update the facilities with the most recent guidance (from the State and CDC) and communicate via conference calls to address issues as they arise.”

Calls to the Northampton Health Department to learn about its monitoring process for nursing homes in the city went unanswered on Tuesday and Wednesday.

In an interview Wednesday, Morse said that after revelations about the Holyoke Soldiers’ Home, he directed the city’s board of health to reach out to every nursing home and long-term care facility in the city to get a sense of their response, procedures, protocols and personal protective equipment levels. Some concerns were even brought up by workers, family members of residents and, in some cases, administrators looking for help, according to Morse.

“We have regular conversations with these folks and (when) we peel back some of the layers, it’s evident some don’t have the capacity, the expertise, the support or the staffing,” Morse said.

He said that since these facilities are connected with the state DPH as they are given the ability to operate, the state should be able to send response teams to “evaluate and make sure these facilities are following proper protocols and procedures.” He said the state has been able to get more staff into the city’s Soldiers’ Home and could help with resource issues and with testing.

Intervention at the Soldiers’ Home was “too late,” said Morse said, adding that it would have been worse without help from the state.

“Are the nursing homes actually following protocols and procedures? And if they’re not, the quicker we can get in and assess that the better chance we have of keeping people healthy and saving lives,” Morse said. “Every minute matters, every day matters, every week matters, and I think that’s important.”

For many seniors, the abrupt ending to college has been anything but easy. But for students like Zhou, it has sparked a whole new outlook on life.

“I started to feel the gaze when I was walking on the street, probably around February, when the U.S. started to first see cases of the coronavirus.”

Zhou, an international student from Beijing, China, has been studying economics and photography at the University of Wisconsin - Madison for the past four years. Following the first break of news around COVID-19 in February, Zhou started noticing a major increase in acts of racism around her.

After spotting graffiti on UW- Madison campus reading, “It’s from China, #chinesevirus” Zhou shared a picture of the chalked words on her Instagram page. Zhou was shocked because she always thought of UW-Madison as an inclusive, welcoming campus.

“Even though I knew there were acts of racism in (New York City) and other places, never have I thought the hatred was spreading so fast that it has put me in danger as well,” Zhou said.

In sharing a picture of the racist graffiti on social media, Zhou tagged the UW, the International Student Services account and some local restaurants. She hoped her post would “make people more aware of the discrimination the Asian community is facing right now and become supportive.” The post has roughly 700 likes and over 200 comments.

Unfortunately, some of those 200-plus comments are “full of hatred and ignorance,” Zhou said. She highlighted examples including: “Everyone here needs to stop being so offended and accept that the world doesn’t revolve around you, and it will never be fair. Life isn’t fair”, and “Just because you are Chinese does not mean you need to complain about the disease being named its rightful name. What about the Spanish Flu?!”

Zhou explained that she felt both confused and frustrated, asking some commentators “if they are willing to call H1N1 the ‘American Virus’ and they didn’t respond to that.”

After attempting to argue with the hurtful comments through direct messages on Instagram, Zhou pivoted her stance and turned to photography.

“Combining the pictures that I took of Chinatown in Chicago and the quotes from the comments (eliminating the swearing words), I let the viewer decide if the comments made sense. Would the viewer resonate with them, or the other way around?”

When asked about the impact of her photography, Zhou said “there is never enough awareness of these matters in the Chinese community, but there has to be somebody to speak up about it.”

Following the initial flood of harsh words, however, friends, classmates and even UW alumni have shown support. The university also commented: “You’re right: this is NOT okay. UW- Madison stands against hate in all forms… We support our Asian and Asian American communities. Now, more than ever, it’s important that we stand together.”

Just a day after Zhou’s post, Chancellor Rebecca Blank released a statement on behalf of the UW- Madison community calling for an immediate end to bigotry.

“We are aware of an increase in bias incidents on or near campus and online that have targeted our Asian, Pacific Islander, and Desi-American students and employees, particularly those from or perceived to be from China and East Asia,"" the statement read. ""We want to be clear that racist behaviors or stereotyping of any kind are not tolerated at UW–Madison—no matter if we are online, passing others in public, or quarantined at home.”

A virtual town hall was called on March 26, allowing students to voice concerns and hear how the university was responding to bias incidents. UW- Madison students facing such harassment or discrimination were also encouraged to file bias incident reports with the school.

Zhou said she was appreciative of the efforts put forth by the university but still admits she is somewhat afraid.

“I wish for someday that we are all united and race will no longer be an issue.”"

On 16 April, Newsweek sounded the alarm over the activation of the Joint Task Force National Capital Region (JTF-NCR), a 10,000-strong military grouping charged with protecting and evacuating US civil and military leaders from Washington DC and surrounding counties. According to the magazine, the activation is no coincidence, as Washington DC, Maryland, and Virginia may face a New York-like epidemic, ""that could potentially cripple the government"".

There is nothing particularly alarming about the JTF-NCR standby mode, echoes Dr Philip Giraldi, a former CIA case officer. He notes that he frequently sees helicopters flying overhead practicing evacuation procedures in Virginia, about 50 miles from Washington, which is not too far from where he lives.

The Joint Force Headquarters National Capital Region (JFHQ-NCR) has been carrying out ""secret"" aerial trainings in the capital area for quite a while already, according to July and December 2019 Bloomberg reports. The mission, involving at least 10 UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters, has been going on since 1 October 2018 and is reportedly aimed at responding to a terrorist attack or natural disaster, with its duration ""undetermined"".

The government evacuation would only take place if the situation gets very bad and if there would be civil unrest so bad that the police would be unable to handle the situation, the CIA veteran explains.

It is unlikely that the government evacuation operations would require JTF-NCR's 10,000-strong personnel, believes Mark Avrum Gubrud, an adjunct assistant professor in peace, war, and defence at the University of North Carolina. It is similarly ""difficult to see how the pandemic itself would create a need for such an evacuation"", he adds.

However, the professor worries that the JTF-NCR mission may create ""risks of the abuse of authority, and even a potential for the inappropriate use of force against the public"".

The rumours about the potential use of military force and even an introduction of martial law have been swirling despite the Pentagon's reassurances after thousands of National Guard troops were mobilised in every US state and territory in response to the coronavirus pandemic.

Those circumstances ""do not and almost surely will not exist here"", according to Banks. Being controlled in each state by the governors, the US military may, as they are now, provide critically needed public health and logistical support, the professor elaborates.

""These claims are false"", agrees Robert James Spitzer, an American political scientist and commentator ""There is no plan, or reason, for declaring martial law in the US. It is a rumour designed only to sow doubt and anxiety among Americans about their government"".

The political commentator observes that the First and the Second Amendment – the individual right to keep and bear arms – provide the first and second layers of protection against potential attempts at abuse of power: ""As such, it provides significant motivation to keep politicians’ actions within the limits of the US Constitution"", he concludes."

Shawn C. Rowland was first contacted by troopers at 8 p.m. Tuesday at his home. Earlier in the day, a threatening message was left on the voicemail for the Governor’s Office of Constituent Services by someone using Rowland’s phone, according to the state patrol.

The investigation revealed the same phone had been used in an earlier threat made against the Virginia state Legislature in February.

Rowland was arrested and is being processed through the court system, according to the state patrol.

“These are indeed troubling times for all of us,” WSP Chief John Batiste said in a statement. “And there are certainly points of consideration and debate in this unprecedented pandemic environment.

365,365,https://portfolio-adviser.com/dfms-bide-their-time-on-negative-oil-prices/,DFMs bide their time on negative oil prices,WTI contracts hit by 'double whammy' of supply glut and coronavirus lockdown,portfolio-adviser.com,"Discretionary fund managers are taking a wait-and-see approach to dialling up their limited exposure to oil as prices hit unprecedented negative territory.

Contracts on West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark for US oil, plunged below -$40 on Monday as the coronavirus lockdown created a massive slump in demand compounding the existing supply glut led by Saudi Arabia and Russia. As oil storage reached capacity, traders rushed to exit contracts before taking physical delivery.

Architas senior investment manager Mayank Markanday (pictured) describes this as a “double whammy effect” whereas normally supply drives prices and demand is much more predictable.

Architas currently only has exposure to oil through Pimco GIS Commodity Real Return fund, which represents less than 5% of the Diversified Real Assets portfolio. It started the year with more exposure via the Pimco MLP Infrastructure fund but reduced the position over Q1 before cutting it completely in March when the Opec-Russia meeting broke down.

Markanday says while the oil price looks “optically” attractive, there would need to be positive signals coming from the supply side before he considered dialling up exposure in the fund.

Markanday says: “Ideally you need both Opec or Opec+ to make production costs, as well as the US to make production cuts. If that happens, that could be a catalyst for us to become slightly more positive on oil. But at current levels, the volatility and the price has been too risky a trade.

“Trump has talked about filling up his strategic reserves to the maximum level. But I don’t think that’s enough, more needs to be done. The US government basically needs to work with oil producers to shut down production and shut down their wells. And, there needs to be some sort of relief package on the other side of that to support some of these firms.”

Approximately 1.15 million people are employed in the US upstream energy sector with a further 1.4 million working in transmission, distribution and storage.

Equities look through the current oil price weakness

Other investment managers Portfolio Adviser spoke with also had low exposure to the commodity.

Premier Diversified fund manager Neil Birrell says the range’s small exposure to oil was via oil companies and that this week’s events would have little impact on positioning.

Janus Henderson said in a note issued on Wednesday that oil majors such as BP and Shell appeared to signal long-term oil prices at $55 a barrel. “Given renewed OPEC discipline and non-OPEC supply cuts it is reasonable to expect healthier oil prices over the course of the year and into 2021. Equities are forward looking and they have indeed been looking through the current oil price weakness,” said Janus Henderson natural resources senior investment manager Tal Lomnitzer.

Numeg has around 3 to 4% of its equity allocations in the energy sector, says head of investment risk Pacome Breton. “The main contributor is our allocation to the FTSE 100, which has 11.3% in energy, and in the US, the allocation to energy was 4.5% at the beginning of this year.”

High yield and emerging market debt were other areas of the portfolio sensitive to the oil price, Breton says.

Equity income is the primary concern at Hawksmoor Investment Management, says CIO private clients and head of research Jim Wood-Smith.

“Our primary concern is what impact this will have on the dividends to be paid by the major oil stocks, which are typically a major weighting in value and income funds,” Wood-Smith says.

“It is not at all clear what will happen; a reasonable expectation is that payments will be cut by at least half, but it is quite possible that the payments will be passed altogether this year.”

Tilney tends to keep exposure to oil limited throughout the cycle, says head of multi-asset Ben Seager-Scott.

“Overall, our core strategy tends to favour those investing in those higher quality companies that can deliver throughout the economic cycle, and this leads us to generally have only limited exposure to energy at the best of times – often as a tactical position, so at the moment we don’t have very much exposure to energy at all,” Seager-Scott says.

Oil ETPs out of favour with fund pickers

Although Nutmeg currently has no energy sector ETF exposure that could change if oil prices decline to levels “that seem totally unjustified in the mid-term”, says Breton.

The robo-adviser does not invest directly in exchange traded oil products in order to limit the impact of significant price movements on the portfolio. The complexity of the structures, with many being derivatives based, and the cost associated often make them unattractive, Breton says.

This is because they have large retail ownership that can make them sentiment driven and due to the fact they typically buy front-end contracts, which are more exposed to live crude price and therefore more volatile.

“Whereas if you were to buy an active manager, they can they can pick and choose where on the curve where they want to buy. They could still benefit from an improving outlook for oil, without necessarily the volatility of the front-end contracts,” he says.

UK assets an avenue for multi-asset funds to dial up oil exposure

Sterling, UK equities and value managers are among the ways Architas would dial up exposure to oil in its multi-asset portfolios, says Markanday, if it decides the commodity has become attractive.

you could increase the allocation to value managers. That would benefit from their overweight to the energy sector.

“UK equities, as a whole, if you were to access it in a passive way would benefit, compared to world equities,” he says. “Sterling could also strengthen on the back of oil bouncing, again linked to the fact that the UK economy has a bias to energy.”

He adds: “You could also increase an allocation to a broad-based commodity manager, where energy is going to be a third or a quarter of the portfolio.”

What does negative oil prices mean for decarbonisation?

Hawksmoor is unsure on how the oil price will affect decarbonisation, says Wood-Smith

“It will be easy and cheap for businesses to rely on oil, rather than renewables, for longer; on the other hand, a slow and gradual restart of economies may see a greater willingness for businesses to go straight to renewable power,” he says.

Janus Henderson’s Lomnitzer said low oil prices could accelerate existing trends away from fossil fuels as governments use lower prices unwind subsidies. Fiscal stimulus could also be used to boost clean energy programmes.

The Janus Henderson Global Resources strategy is currently underweight oil producers with a preference for companies benefiting from the carbon transition. It is also invested in shipping, storage and refiners.

But Blackrock Energy and Resources have been adding to energy companies, arguing in a webinar this week that balance sheets were strong and expressing confidence the stock’s would continue to pay their dividends in the near term. That is despite the investment trust announcing in March that it would increasingly be shifting its focus to companies focused on the transition away from carbon-based energy.

The managers expect oil to trade around $20 in the near-term until the coronavirus lockdown is lifted."

South African Tristan Vanderwatt started working at Gippsland Grammar in 2019 as a support staffer for boarders after moving for a gap-year.

Shortly after he turned 20 in April last year he contacted one student on social media to come and “cuddle” with him in his room.

The girl reported Vanderwatt but the school “negligently” didn’t sack him, Judge Paul Higham said in the County Court on Thursday.

Instead he was warned about the “unacceptability of his behaviour”. Two months later he crashed a vehicle that belonged to the school while drink driving.

“Astonishingly you were again allowed to continue in the role despite your demonstrated unsuitability,” the judge said.

He contacted two of his victims shortly after the crash on social media apps SnapChat and HouseParty where he sent explicit messages to the girls aged 14 and 15.

Vanderwatt had sex with the 14-year-old girl, sneaking her into the school’s gym after midnight and taking her to his bedroom on other occasions. The offending continued for months before a male student told the head of boarding about his suspicions.

Despite initially denying the allegations, Vanderwatt confessed and was kicked off school property and the police were called.

He was nabbed trying to flee the country in December before admitting to his crimes in a police interview.

“You sought sexual intimacy with the children in the care of the school,” Judge Higham said.

Though the now-21-year-old was warned about his behaviour it was ignored and clear boundaries were broken, the judge said.

While Judge Higham accepted Vanderwatt was far from home and felt lonely and isolated, it did not condone or legitimise the offending.

Vanderwatt pleaded guilty to one count of encouraging a child under 16 to engage in sexual activity and two counts of sexual penetration of a child under 16. The judge took into account the man’s youth, good prospects of rehabilitation, guilty plea, genuine remorse and immaturity.

Vanderwatt sobbed and wiped his eyes as he was jailed for three years. He must serve at least 20 months before he is eligible for parole."

All three main U.S. stock indexes fell back from gains of over 1% after the Financial Times reported that a Chinese trial showed that Gilead Science’s (GILD.O) remdesivir did not improve patients’ condition or reduce the pathogen’s presence in the bloodstream.

Gilead said results from the study were inconclusive as it was terminated early.

Last Friday, Wall Street rallied in part because of a report that COVID-19 patients in a separate study had responded positively to remdesivir.

The market’s sensitivity to news related to coronavirus therapies reflects investors’ desperation for any indication of when the global economy might be able to start returning to normal.

“The hope as of last week was that Gilead could take the fear of dying off the table, which would result in a much quicker, cleaner, faster recovery. If that’s less likely today than it was yesterday, it is perfectly reasonable for the market to have sold off,” said David Katz, chief investment officer at Matrix Asset Advisors.

Stocks rallied earlier after data that showed weekly U.S. jobless claims fell to 4.43 million from a revised 5.24 million. However, the numbers were still staggering, taking the total in the past five weeks to a record 26 million and wiping out all the jobs created since the financial crisis.

“The disappointing drug news stings, but considering another 4 million people lost their jobs, the disconnect between how well stocks have held up in the face of historically bad economic data continues,” said Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist at LPL Financial.

Meanwhile, the U.S. Congress was preparing nearly $500 billion more in aid for small businesses and hospitals, which was expected to clear the House of Representatives later in the day.

U.S. stock indexes have rallied this month on a raft of global stimulus, but the benchmark S&P 500 remains more than 15% below its record high as worsening economic indicators foreshadow a deep global recession.

A survey showed U.S. business activity plumbed record lows in April, mirroring dire figures from Europe and Asia as strict stay-at-home orders crushed production, supply chains and consumer spending.

The CBOE volatility index has retreated from 12-year peaks hit last month, but remains well above levels seen in the past two years and analysts have warned of another sell-off as corporate America issues worrying forecasts for the year.

In extended trade, Intel (INTC.O) dropped over 5% after the chipmaker gave a quarterly profit forecast that missed analysts’ estimates.

In Thursday’s session, advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.64-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.50-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

Here is his letter in full.,www.fin24.com,"We would like to make the following points on Covid-19.

Firstly, please note that these are the current thoughts of the PSG Group Board. Even though we have read numerous articles, have listened to experts from both sides, are constantly thinking about the consequences of the pandemic and obtain input from all those around us, none of us have a medical background. We are also aware of the fact that the President may address certain or all of our concerns this evening.

PSG Group is a company that employs more than 20,000 people throughout various industries within our group. We pay salaries, we pay taxes and we have contributed positively to our economy for the past 25 years. We as PSG Group lie awake at night as we have a major responsibility to all our employees and their families, to our clients, our suppliers, our bankers, our Government and ultimately to the people of our country. To remain quiet during this crisis is unfortunately no longer an option for us and silence will certainly not be of benefit to anyone.

We must start by congratulating President Ramaphosa and his cabinet on the quick and decisive way in which they acted to address the pandemic. It is great to see that our leadership and country can act swiftly and with purpose. That we can stand together to achieve a common goal. We understand from various medical opinions published in the media, that we have potentially bought enough time to be as ready as one can be to face what may come. Mr. President, whatever we say hereafter is not to criticize your administration or question your actions. You are between a rock and a hard place and we do not envy your position. It is not an easy task to balance different concerns.

But here is the issue as we see it – the lockdown and especially the potential extension or failure to adequately relax restrictions are causing severe damage to what is left of our fragile economy. The longer it takes to come out of the lockdown, the worse it will be going forward for every citizen of South Africa. Alternatively, if we have a system whereby we move in and out of lockdown depending on the number of infections, this too will have a similar disastrous effect. The only option is a continued lockdown of the elderly and frail until the virus is contained or a vaccine becomes available, while the economy operates as close to normal as possible.
• READ | PSG’s Mouton: SA does not have 'the luxury' to remain in lockdown

Please understand us correctly – we are NOT arguing economy over lives. BUT the truth is that lives are inextricably linked to the economy. Our survival and wellbeing depend on whether and how quickly our economy recovers.

Our economy is struggling, and we are running at a significant budget deficit with already worrying levels of debt, high unemployment and struggling parastatals. We do not have the means to provide meaningful relief packages on a sustainable basis without further loading the debt burden to such an extent that we may never be able to repay it, or struggle to do so. South Africa has recently been downgraded to junk status and has been assigned a negative outlook – so any new debt will become even more expensive. We entered this Covid-19 war already wounded.

Government’s primary source of income to address the pandemic, drive relief and provide stimuli for economic growth is one of the things that is under attack…namely tax collection. More than 80% of tax revenue is derived from personal tax, corporate tax and VAT.

Many businesses earn no revenue at the moment, while others do very little:
• As a result, significant less VAT and corporate tax will be collected.
• Businesses have stopped paying their rent and other suppliers as they simply cannot afford to – resulting in a very negative economic spiral and ever-decreasing VAT and income tax revenue.
• As far as individuals are concerned, they too have stopped paying rent, servicing debt and consumer spending is down significantly as a result of the lockdown. Again, less economic activity means less VAT.
• We can expect most companies that survive the lockdown to make significantly lower profits, if any, for the year – so very little corporate tax will be collected. Similarly, tax losses will also have a negative impact on future year tax revenue for Government.
• According to Stats SA, 42% of formal sector business surveyed fear they will not have the financial resources to survive and 85% have already seen a decline in revenue.
• There will be significant job losses – which translates to the loss of personal tax revenue, loss of spending power for the individual and an increase in Government grants to be paid.
• Most of our SMEs do not have surplus reserves – many of them will close forever with a consequent loss of jobs and tax. Relief funds may assist a few, but most will unfortunately not make it.
• The decrease in interest rates is understandable given the state of the economy, but it will not be enough to assist most SMEs and will do very little for the man in the street – and again tax collections will suffer.

It is therefore clear to us that Government will experience a significant decline in tax revenue resulting in the already noteworthy budget deficit widening even further. We must ask ourselves realistically – where is the money going to come from to reinvigorate the economy and pay for an ever-increasing social bill? Less people will be able to contribute to the South African treasury and far more will become utterly dependent on it.

Yes, the Solidarity Fund, to which we also contribute, is a worthy initiative to assist but may not be enough. According to a recent study, the economy is losing R13bn per day during the lockdown, and we will still lose billions even if we partially open or totally open up the economy. On Tuesday evening, President Ramaphosa announced a R500bn economic support package representing 10% of South Africa’s GDP.

This will comprise various measures and will seemingly be funded by the likes of the World Bank, the IMF and the BRICS Development Bank, as well as the reallocation of previously set budgets and the utilisation of UIF reserves. Although an admirable effort, realistically we need to be clear it will in the end mainly be a relief intervention directed towards preventing a full-blown humanitarian disaster rather than an economic stimulus. Again, a further increase in debt of this magnitude will unfortunately have dire long-term consequences for our economy and our country.

We understand that Covid-19 will be part of our reality for the foreseeable future. In the President’s announcement on Tuesday, he hinted at a phased relaxation of the lockdown restrictions of which the details will only be announced later today. We don’t want to deter from the President’s message, but we are trying to convey a reality as we see it and to emphasize that South Africa cannot afford to long or too slowly to revert normal activities.

My father, who I greatly admire, taught me that you cannot just sit back and complain if you don’t have a better solution. Furthermore, it is of no use that I nod my head to everything proposed by Government, but behind closed doors differ as so many people in the business community do. No one wants to make unpopular statements and become a target on social media for those who will later also be the first to claim what should have been done. This has never been our style.

We therefore publicly request Government to carefully consider the extent of further restrictions and the urgency to return to economic activity. We believe South Africa should act much faster in lifting restrictions to rejuvenate the economy. We agree with scientists that we should protect the elderly and those with compromised immunity with continued isolation protocols in place for them. We too have elderly loved ones, as well as friends who suffer from cancer and other diseases that make them especially vulnerable – and we want them protected. The rest of us, however, need to get back to work. We agree with Government that a lot more testing should be done as we move forward. Further, we need to understand that in the absence of any vaccine for the disease in the short to medium term, we need to obtain herd immunity sooner rather than later.

We acknowledge that this means more people will be infected and that some may become very ill. There will undoubtedly be a cost of lives, but we’re afraid that if we are bluntly honest with one another we are heading for an immense cost of lives in any event. If not from Covid-19, from starvation, social unrest, crime and a myriad of other chronic diseases which will follow. The fabric of our society will also be severely affected and damaged – polarization of people will be driven to the extreme. Just one example where it is very evident, is the closing of schools – those with digital means can home school to some extent while the poor are again left behind and exposed – and an educated youth is our future. The consequences are severe no matter which way we argue it.

Please do not consider our abbreviated opinion as being heartless – it is exactly because we care about the well-being and the future of our citizens, our children, your children and our country which we all love that we’re speaking up. It will not help if we sugar coat our message today to appease a specific group or endear ourselves to the popular view. We need to be honest about what lies ahead if we want to win the war – not just against Covid-19, but against the hardship that will follow. We are a South African company heavily invested in South Africa. We continue to invest our shareholders’ money, to support Government efforts, to create jobs and to assist in growing the economy for the benefit of all stakeholders. In theory and on paper one can therefor plan a release of restrictions over several months, but in practice, given the state of our economy, we unfortunately do not have the luxury of time to do so.

South Africans are resilient, entrepreneurial and hard-working human beings.

372,372,https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/23/politics/state-of-play-small-business-administration-money/,Small business money to clear Congress on Thursday but question of who gets aid looms over program,"The US House of Representatives will vote to send an additional $310 billion to the Small Business Administration's emergency lending program, kicking off the second run at a program that faced glitches, hurdles, problems and public outcry in its initial rollout.",www.cnn.com,"(CNN) The US House of Representatives will vote to send an additional $310 billion to the Small Business Administration's emergency lending program , kicking off the second run at a program that faced glitches , hurdles, problems and public outcry in its initial rollout.

Yet that same program is so desperately needed -- and oversubscribed -- that it ran out of money the first time in less than two weeks.

Bottom line: There is a tension with this program akin to what most rescue programs face -- how do you kick as much money out the door as possible, as quickly as possible, while ensuring only the small businesses that truly need the money, get it? The dozens of public companies, some of which appeared to have clear pathways to more traditional financing, who received loans in the first tranche make clear the balance between those two sides wasn't right the first time around. Officials, through public shaming and a new set of guidelines, will attempt to shift that starting Thursday.

The changes to the program

There weren't many. Well, there weren't any in terms of how the program is constructed. But lawmakers did include a new set aside of $60 billion that is designed to get money to smaller lenders, lenders with connections to minority owned small businesses or those with limited or no bank relationships. The inclusion of Community Development Financial Institutions, which traditionally aren't SBA lenders, in this set aside is specifically designed to help minority and underbanked small businesses.

Treasury and the Small Business Administration have made a big point of the fact 74% of the loans that were approved in the first tranche were for $150,000 or less -- and that's no small thing given that made up 1.2 million loans. But flip the data a bit and you get a better sense of the actual distribution of the money.

According to the SBA's data, roughly 45% of the actual money went toward loans for more than $1 million. In total, $152.4 billion of the first tranche of funds went toward loans of more than $1 million.

The Small Business Administration is still working through exactly how to separate out that $60 billion it guaranteed to smaller lenders, according to industry sources.

Those sources say that if there is a separate portal, that could force some banks that have been entering application information waiting for the program to get flush with cash again, to start over. And, it could create hiccups once again for lenders who have to use another portal.

The money was intended to make it easier for smaller lenders to get money to small businesses. But the specifics of how the set-aside fund will work is still being sorted out.

What else to keep an eye on

The Treasury Department released on Thursday morning new guidelines for participants in the program designed to, in the words of one official, ""disincentivize"" larger public companies who may qualify for the program from applying.

The guidelines make clear that the certification of economic harm required for each application must take into account a company's ability to secure financing through more traditional means. It also gives any company that believes it erred in applying for, and receiving, a Payment Protection Program loan the opportunity to repay it in full by May 7.

The reality here is this is not a substantive change or laying out of ""severe consequences"" -- the certification has always been required and the consequences for fraudulently signing off on that have always remained the same. But this guidance is designed for a clear purpose: to highlight a willingness to warn and publicly shame, which as CNN has previously reported is about all they can do given how the program was implemented into law.

Putting this on the radar

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's remarks about funding for state and local governments yesterday underscored just how deep the policy divide is between some congressional Republicans and their Democratic colleagues. But McConnell is also in a different place than some his own members.

CNN's Cristina Alesci, who is following this closely, sends this along as well: Earlier in the day, state budget officers from both blue and red states, wrote a pointed letter to Trump and Congress, pleading for federal aid.

""Given the sudden, severe, and unprecedented nature of this crisis and its economic impacts ... states will still be forced to cut essential services in order to balance their budgets,"" wrote the National Association of State Budget Officers (NASBO) in the letter.

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat who has been seeking federal aid for weeks now, called McConnell's statement ""political repugnant.""

McConnell's statement backs up CNN's reporting earlier this week: that Republicans are hesitant to move quickly on funding state relief.

One of the toughest pieces of the stimulus package to negotiate was the Main Street Lending Program. It was that $600 billion program that was run out of the Federal Reserve aimed at helping medium to large businesses. This is, without question, a central component of the full rescue package, and yet it hasn't launched yet.

Somewhat stunningly, according to one congressional aide, it could still take two or more weeks to launch.

There is growing angst in industry and on Capitol Hill that this program is taking more time than is desirable to get off the ground. But, there are a few reasons for that. For one, this is a massive program, and remember what happened with the Paycheck Protection Program? The rush to get it launched led to some early glitches. The Fed wants to avoid any early fumbles, and by nature the Fed tends to be very deliberate and conservative about decisions they make in how to structure this program.

Guidance in early April made it clear that while the Fed will take on 95% of the risk, lenders will be on the hook for the other 5%. That, according to one congressional aide familiar with the program, could be problematic for lenders who aren't interested in taking on more risk right now.

Remember, during the Payment Protection Program, many banks were worried about approving loan applications early on. Some banks sat on the sidelines until they had clearer guidance from Treasury. Those were for loans that were 100% government guaranteed. Now, you are talking about far larger loans that banks will have a share of the risk in. And, everything about this program is going to be scrutinized because of the Congressional Oversight Commission -- that five-person panel -- that has broad jurisdiction to scrutinize the program in addition to the other oversight panels.

As the program is written, expect it to be a fairly narrow channel for borrowers that need additional liquidity to get them through the next 12 months. But given that banks are going to have to take on risk here, borrowers are likely going to have to demonstrate pretty solid balance sheets prior to the pandemic to be eligible for the money.

This story has been updated with additional developments Thursday."

FinTech Australia focused on COVID-19's impact on the sector in its second submission to the Senate Inquiry on fintech and regtech.

“This submission details our view on how COVID-19 has impacted our industry and why, despite the extraordinary measures taken by the government already, more needs to be done,” said Rebecca Schot-Guppy, GM of FinTech Australia.

Among other concerns, the submission highlighted oversights within the standing COVID-19 stimulus measures, such as all lenders, including fintech non-ADI lenders, being automatically disqualified from applying for JobKeeper payments.

The group has called for an immediate exception to be made for non-bank lenders.

The group also detailed short and longer term support from the government which would help ensure the fintech sector can become and remain internationally competitive and can continue to buoy employment as the country recovers from COVID-19.

“While some components, like technical exemptions from the JobKeeper allowance for lenders, can be flagged for immediate change by the Treasurer, others will require discussion and a willingness to invest in our innovation industry as a creator of jobs,” said Schot-Guppy.

“Australia won’t be the first to act on such measures. We are suggesting steps that have been taken in the UK and Singapore.

“We welcome a robust discussion with the government on how to ensure fintech and other innovation industries contribute to Australia’s economic recovery and also create jobs for more Australians.”

The Senate announced the establishment of the committee to inquire and report on the fintech and regtech sectors within Australia in October of this year.

The group examines the scope of opportunity presented by fintech for both consumers and businesses, barriers to the uptake of new technologies in the financial sector, and the effectiveness of current initiatives in promoting a positive environment for start-ups - among other considerations."

O’Neill, who was named Stoke boss in November, on Wednesday stepped down as manager of the Green and White Army after it emerged their Euro 2020 qualifying play-offs – due to be his final games in charge – would not be played before October due to the coronavirus pandemic.

It ended a hugely successful spell in charge, highlighted by qualification for Euro 2016 but marked more broadly by consistency in results, with O’Neill’s win rate of 36 per cent second only in Northern Ireland’s history to Bertie Peacock’s 39 per cent between 1961 and 1964.

After O’Neill was appointed in late 2011, a major renovation of Windsor Park took place between 2013 and 2016, which O’Neill believes helped change his squad’s mindset.

“I remember at the outset one or two senior players coming to me to talk about the pitch at Windsor Park,” O’Neill said. “It was pretty evident they didn’t particularly enjoy playing at home in Belfast at the time.

“That’s understandable because the ground, for international football, there was very little behind the dug-outs that could be used.

“There was a portable stand behind the top goal and basically it was pieced together into what was usable. I don’t think any of that situation with the stadium helped the team or previous managers.

“I remember the time when Portugal came to play us and they didn’t have enough room to get their stuff into the dressing room.

“Things like that I used to think would help us but ultimately our mindset changed with the stadium and the team grew and I think that was shown with our performances.

“If you look back there are not many games since the redevelopment of the stadium when the team played poorly and the players didn’t play with a tempo and an energy.”

While he waits for news on when Stoke’s Championship campaign might be able to resume, O’Neill can take some time to reflect on his Northern Ireland reign.

But while he can pick out certain games as highlights – beating Greece to reach Euro 2016, drawing away to Portugal in 2012 or beating Russia in 2013 – O’Neill pointed instead to the pride he helped restore in playing for the Green and White Army.

“Having the mindset of every time we took to the pitch, especially at home, we felt we could win,” he said.

“We sometimes had to fight for our lives but other than the last game (a 6-1 defeat to Germany in November) when we were under-strength, no one wiped the floor with us.

“I take great pride in beating Azerbaijan 4-0 at home (in November 2016) and then playing a friendly with Croatia. Jonny Evans went home because his wife was having their second child but he flew back in on the Tuesday morning to play in the friendly.

“That just wouldn’t have happened in the past and when you see that commitment, that’s when you know you were going in the right direction.”

With the manager gone and some key players nearing the end of their careers this could be the end of an era, but O’Neill expects the likes of Steven Davis, 35, and Evans, 32, to keep going for a while yet.

“I know Steven will play on and break Pat’s record,” he said, with Davis two caps shy of Pat Jennings’ record of 119 caps for Northern Ireland.

“Jonny has ambitions to get 100 caps (the Leicester defender has 84) and more, and there will be others.

“The players still have an awful lot to play for. My biggest regret in my playing career was not getting more international caps.”"
379,379,https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/how-iatse-will-push-congress-help-work-hollywood-freelancers-1291455,How IATSE Will Push Congress to Help Out of Work Hollywood Freelancers,The International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE) made it clear that Hollywood's fight for further financial relief from the federal government isn't over yet when it published an ambitious political agenda for future coronavirus relief packages Thursday.,www.hollywoodreporter.com,"The union's political and legislative director explains why OSHA mandates, pension relief and more Payment Protection Program loans are needed to protect entertainment workers.

Though many in the industry cheered in late March when some provisions in the CARES Act directly benefited entertainment workers, Hollywood's fight for further financial relief from the federal government is hardly over yet.

The International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE), which represents 145,000 entertainment workers, made that clear when it published an ambitious political agenda for future coronavirus relief packages on Thursday. ""IATSE Priorities for Subsequent COVID-19 Relief Legislation"" offers up seven major goals for the labor union in its upcoming lobbying and activism: to persuade the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to issue emergency health standards for members working in television news and constructing field hospitals; to implement policies that protected pensions after the Great Recession; to extend Payment Protection Program (PPP) loans to all nonprofits (like labor unions), not just 501(c)3 organizations; to ensure health care for California's unemployed and in labor unions; to pass the Performing Artist Tax Parity Act (also an agenda item on actors' union SAG-AFTRA's slate); to extend CARE Act unemployment insurance through Dec. 31, 2020; and to gain financial stimulus funds to get the industry running again.

IATSE did not secure one of its agenda items — gaining PPP loans for all nonprofits — in the final version of the $484 billion package that Congress is poised to pass to replenish a fund providing interest-free loans to small businesses. However, the union is moving forward with all of these priorities for future legislation, says IATSE political and legislative director Tyler McIntosh. ""We know for a fact that there is broad support amongst the Democratic Caucus and in the House,"" he says.

To further explain the union's political priorities, concerns among members and how IATSE is helping to prepare Hollywood to go back to work, McIntosh spoke to The Hollywood Reporter on Wednesday.

Why was now the right time for IATSE to issue these legislative priorities for future coronavirus relief packages?

Frankly, it's an existential moment for our members and a crisis that we as a union and as an industry, for that matter, have never faced. We've seen approximately 90 percent or more of our membership in the United States and Canada presently out of work. The entire entertainment industry is dark. With this degree of unemployment, we were incredibly active in the early going legislatively in what came to be known as the CARES Act. The second legislative package, the Families First Coronavirus Act, made some extensions to paid leave provisions federally. Most of our members are entertainment freelance workers who don't qualify for traditional paid leave or unemployment benefits because of the requirements for days worked on the job to qualify and things of that nature. So we had to [fight] tooth and nail and raise our voices together to get Congress to realize that our entire sector was really left out of the traditional unemployment benefits.

Now, as we shift our gaze to the ongoing crisis, which we anticipate will continue for quite some time, we have a lot of additional priorities that need to be addressed by Congress and subsequent legislation. Many of our members and locals have weighed in and made us aware of their concerns and the issues facing them on a day-to-day basis. All of that was taken under consideration in formulating these subsequent priorities.

What is the union currently doing to try and get this list in front of legislators?

This has been circulated by the political legislative department of IATSE to Capitol Hill at this point, and we are in the process of creating a follow-on grassroots campaign similar to one that we're doing to highlight Congress' work: We have a campaign underway that is a genuine thank-you campaign to Congress to commend them for including entertainment workers in the CARES Act. We anticipate members will continue to make their voices known and highlight these specific priorities for CARES 2.0 or ""Phase 4"" or whatever this next package ends up being dubbed that hopefully will come together in the coming weeks.

Have any of these priorities been addressed in the $484 billion package to replenish funds intended to help small businesses that the Senate passed Tuesday?

Unfortunately not, [though] we did do some significant lobbying of Congress. We did work very diligently to raise our voices on one particular issue within that bill and that is the fact that within the Paycheck Protection Program, small businesses are eligible for those low-interest loans, as are 501(c)3 nonprofit organizations. However, we made a big push to provide fair access to that economic support for all nonprofits including labor unions, which are organized as 501(c)5s, and were left out of that support program. We have over 320 U.S. locals right now that are facing reductions in dues and the financial constraints of folks being out of work. So they're having to try to make their budgets work and loan access is certainly something that would have been beneficial to them in this package. Unfortunately, there was seemingly not an appetite to expand the eligibility for PPP loans to other nonprofits — we are going to continue to prioritize that in subsequent legislation. We know for a fact that there is broad support amongst the Democratic Caucus and in the House. There's also a ""Dear Colleague"" letter that was authored by Judy Chu from California, Alan Lowenthal from California and Sylvia Garcia from Texas that's circulating around the House right now requesting that 501(c)5 organizations be eligible for this funding.

One of the priorities listed is for OSHA to take immediate emergency steps to protect news media workers and workers converting facilities into hospitals. Why would this be the right step to protect these workers as opposed to other measures, like asking for more paid sick leave?

In terms of why requiring OSHA to issue a temporary emergency standard is the way to go, I want to be clear that this is not an either/or proposition here. I would say providing appropriate paid leave and providing hazard pay for these folks on the front lines is vital and, frankly, they are owed this for putting their lives on the line and lending their skills. The answer is not to say, ""You're getting paid more to put your life on the line."" The health and safety of our members is paramount, so getting a federal mandate from OSHA in terms of protective equipment and social distancing guidelines is absolutely vital in addition to the economic benefits that need to be provided to these people on the front lines. It's an all-inclusive approach in addition to the other benefits that we continue to push for.

You've devoted a priority on this list to entertainment-employee pensions as well. Why are they particularly in danger at this time?

In terms of the International [organization], we have two major pension plans that are administered, and that's the Motion Picture Industry Pension Plan and the IATSE National Pension Fund. Both of those pension plans would be considered healthy pension plans and they were certainly in the ""green zone"" for ranking the health of these pension plans. What endangers them, really, is market volatility. When you see such a drastic effect in the stock market, naturally you are going to see a shock to the funds in the pension plan. Really what we need to do is be allowed things that have happened in previous recoveries, like what we saw in the Great Recession in 2008: the ability to freeze that status as being ""green zone"" as they were before, and the ability to smooth those losses over time. [Those measures] are important for us to be able to continue to have them be considered as they were and not have additional burden placed on these plans.

The other really important part is just that we recognize that direct federal relief is going to be needed for the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation to deal with those multiemployer plans that are critically endangered. But the first principal needs to be to ""do no harm"" to healthy pension plans. We have healthy plans and we have promised benefits to our retirees, so any shoring up of the PBGC cannot come at the expense of healthy plans.

In one priority list item, you say that unemployment benefits that go to entertainment workers should be extended until Dec. 31, 2020. Are you projecting that workers won't be able to go back to business as usual until 2021?

The only certainty at this point is uncertainty. I think everyone in the entertainment industry — workers, employers and frankly those who enjoy arts and entertainment — recognize that this is an industry that is going to be disproportionately impacted for much longer than other industries are. We were some of the first affected; we are also going to be some of the ones who are probably last to resume normal operations even after stay-at-home orders in states start to get relaxed and we start to see some of this opening of states and economies. We are still going to see restrictions on mass gatherings for quite some time to come, so that will affect all of our live events and productions, whether they're theatrical or trade shows or sporting events: You're going to see decreased attendance because of the need to have appropriate distancing.

We're not sure what the guidelines are going to be in terms of safety and I think it would be premature to predict what that will look like, but we do know that these are going to be long-term impacts and we need to prepare for that and recognize that we likely will not get back to our full employment levels that we were at just two months ago until quite some time from now, even if we do see a bulk of our folks going back to work before the end of the year, which is of course our hope. We want to put folks back to work, but we want it to be done safely and we need to recognize that we're still going to have folks who are going to need access to these expanded unemployment provisions and benefits for quite some time to come.

Do you project you will be sending out more of these legislative priorities agendas in weeks and months to come, as further relief bills are being discussed?

Our reality is that we have be nimble and have the ability to react to the needs of our membership and that's what we'll continue to do. I think this document and these priorities have been laid out with the long term in mind. We hope to achieve a lot of these things in the short term, but some of these items are going to be long-term priorities that we're going to have to continue to persist on. I would say we could surely see some other priorities arise as time goes on, but for now we anticipate that this will be our main focus in addition to working closely with some of our major employers across the country on some joint priorities to make sure that our industry is heard from and make sure that we're able to safely and quickly put folks back to work but within reasonable and safe guidelines.

380,380,http://www.china.org.cn/opinion/2020-04/23/content_75954958.htm,China-Africa unity and joint fight against COVID-19 shall not be undermined - China.org.cn,,www.china.org.cn,"Recently, due to allegations of ""mistreatment"" of African citizens in Guangzhou during the local government's coronavirus epidemic prevention and control work, the issue of China-Africa relations has become a focus of domestic and foreign media attention.

Some African and Western media quickly elevated the so-called ""unjust"" treatment to claims that China had discriminated against Africans and even displayed racism in its epidemic prevention and control work.

However, before accepting such claims we need to first understand the origin of the matter and the scope of the people involved, whether it is individual cases or of a universal nature.

Video clips and some social media reports suggested the epidemic prevention and control measures in Guangzhou have only targeted Africans, who appear to have been ""singled out"" for targeted discrimination.

However, investigations have shown that the inability of some African citizens to return to their hotels is a basic cause, since the epidemic prevention and control measures in Guangzhou have to be followed by everyone in the residential areas where there are confirmed cases and close contacts, no matter whether they are locals or foreigners.

On April 14, the Chinese Ambassador to Nigeria Zhou Pingjian and Nigerian Foreign Affairs Minister Geoffrey Onyeama also made a special clarification through a joint press conference in Abuja, saying the issue emerged from the Guangzhou local government requiring closure of the premises and isolation of close contacts after identifying a restaurant where a Nigerian had been diagnosed with COVID-19. Persons who were under quarantine were naturally not allowed to move about.

China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Guangzhou local governments have attached great importance to clearing up any misunderstandings arising from the implementation of the relevant outbreak detection initiatives and urged relevant parties to improve their working mechanisms and methods.

The ministry also stressed that the Chinese government treats all foreign personnel in China equally, opposes any discriminatory practices that target specific groups of people, and has zero tolerance for discriminatory behavior.

In fact, any attempt to destroy China-Africa relations is an unjust and unkind act that can only make ""the near-at-hand saddened and the enemy gladdened."" If China-Africa anti-epidemic cooperation and the China-Africa relations as a whole are frustrated or face stagnation and even regression, it is the governments, enterprises and people of China and Africa that will suffer.

The only ones that benefit from this will be the sensation-seeking Western media and some politicians jealous of the ever-closer China-Africa relations.

As we carefully screen these smears of China-Africa joint efforts to fight the epidemic, it is not hard to see that, in addition to some untruthful African self media reporting, those particularly active in this regard can be found among media and officials in the United States.

U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Tibor Nagy tweeted saying ""videos and stories from Guangzhou are appalling"" and that ""Chinese authorities must do more to stop these attacks against Africans living and working in China.""

U.S. State Department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus retweeted this with an additional comment of ""shameful xenophobia."" Going even beyond the ""Guangzhou Incident"" itself, Ortagus added: ""If you look at the projects in which China is involved in Africa, you can see this kind of abuse and manipulation. China's commitment to Africa has never been fulfilled. China's treatment of Africans, especially students, during the coronavirus outbreak clearly reflects the essence of China's so-called 'partnership' with Africa.""

Thus the U.S. State Department spokesperson quickly went from simply commenting on the ""Guangzhou incident"" to ""China's participation in projects in Africa"" and then going on to attack the ""materialism"" of the China-Africa partnership. This ""triple jump"" approach shows the world the true face of the United States as it seeks to sow discord between China and African countries and undermine their friendship.

In fact, the Trump administration's so-called ""New Africa Strategy"" launched in late 2018 clearly embodies direct name-calling in seeking to curb Chinese and Russian influence in Africa.

In recent years, the United States has hyped the so-called ""China threat,"" describing China's development cooperation programs in Africa as a ""debt trap."" U.S. Secretary of State Pompeo even made it clear that African countries should move from the ""China model"" to the ""American model"" in terms of political and economic development.

It is also because of this policy orientation and purpose of ""Trump's New Africa Strategy"" that the administration quickly smells the ""explosive nature"" of the ""Guangzhou incident,"" seeking to use it to smear and undermine China-Africa relations.

Of course, as an old saying goes, ""sturdy grass withstands high wind, true gold stands the test of fire."" The all-weather partnership between China and Africa, supporting each other, has been tested by all kinds of storm in the history of more than half a century, and it is impossible to plunge into a ""crisis"" simply because of the poor performance of some media coverage and the ridiculous remarks of some politicians. On the contrary, China-Africa friendship, solidarity and cooperation have been continuously strengthened in these tests.

Mike Parson announced the launch of a new tool developed by Google to help health care providers connect with Missouri manufacturers and suppliers of personal protective equipment (PPE).

“It’s vital that we keep our health care workers as protected as possible in the fight against COVID-19,” Parson said. “Manufacturers across the state have answered the call to help protect our health care workers, and we are committed to doing all we can to get this equipment into the hands of those that need it.”

The new tool is a joint effort between the state and the Missouri Hospital Association. It was built to help manufacturers that have shifted production to PPE enter the health care market and connect with buyers.

Over the past month, the Department of Economic Development (DED) has gathered interest from more than 200 manufacturers and suppliers of PPE and invited all of these companies to register in the system.

Likewise, state health care agencies and the Missouri Hospital Association are reaching out to health care providers across the state to ensure they have access and can connect directly with suppliers through the new tool.

Expanding reserves of PPE by opening public and private supply chains is one of the four essential pillars of the “Show Me Strong Recovery” plan introduced by Governor Parson on Friday, April 17.

Missouri businesses interested in selling or manufacturing PPE can contact DED at ded.mo.gov/howtohelp."

The alarm clock that rings at the same time, children go to school, cooking in the evening, going to bed knowing what is going to happen the next day. A kind of rhythm of existence. But when rhythm breaks down, it turns out how fragile is the balance we base our lives on. On the other side, leaving this safety zone forces you to find new dynamics, to search for new geometries from chaos.

As in an unexpected chemical reaction, the elements seek a new stability, a new order. Covid has already brought about enormous changes in our society, and the humans appear again capable of adapting with extreme speed, in search of a new balance. The same dynamics are found in a family, closed at home for two months, looking for a new form of everyday life.

Here in Milano, Lombardia, Italy – perhaps the most affected area in the world by the new coronavirus – this year here winter came in spring. Italy has been in a lock down situation for two months now. The emergency laws enacted by the government are among the most restrictive in the world. You cannot leave the house without a self-certification, and only for urgent reasons. As a photojournalist I worked on the news, on the empty streets, on the masks … But as a narrator I could do nothing but visually tell the changes that were happening quickly around me.

A humanistic background allows me to get closer to the stories I tell with the respect that every person deserves, respect for being told for what they really are, avoiding the path of visual spectacle of pain or poverty. I believe in the value of information as the first thing, for this reason my research does not stop only to the dramatic stories, because our world is fortunately still able to offer stories of great redemption, of rebirths, stories not yet told but that give hope for the future. I have the pleasure of working with magazines like Der Spiegel, Washington Post, CNN, Corriere Della Sera, Io Donna, Mare, Cicero and many others. I’m the proud founder of the non-fiction communication and brand journalism collective Jolly Jolly Grog. I’m also a teacher of photojournalism at IED Milano and Officine Fotografiche.

The outbreak on the Italian-operated Costa Atlantica surfaced Tuesday when officials from Nagasaki and Mitsubishi Heavy Industry, which is in charge of repairs and maintenance on the ship, announced that a crew member developed a cough and fever. By Thursday, 47 crew have tested positive for the virus, a Nagasaki prefectural official Hironori Hashiguchi said.

The ship has 623 crew, including a Japanese translator, and no passengers. It came to Nagasaki after changing its repair plan in China due to the pandemic. Officials did not disclose the nationalities of the crew.

One crew member became seriously ill Wednesday and was sent to a hospital, where he was put on a respirator, officials said.

The remaining staff are without serious symptoms and remain quarantined on board in single rooms, except for those on essential duties, including cooking and delivering food for their colleagues, officials said. Some of the essential crew also are infected.

Details of the movements of the crew are not clear, but officials suspect they had either contracted the virus while in town or when the ship switched crew in the past few weeks.

Mitsubishi initially said the crew never left dock after March 14, when Nagasaki reported its first coronavirus case and asked all crew members to stay on board. But the company acknowledged the following day that some members who passed body temperature checks and other requirements had been allowed off the ship. On Thursday, Mitsubishi said there was a possible switch of crew and that the company was checking with the ship operator, Costa Cruises.

As infections in Japan continue to spread nationwide, the outbreak on ship has raised concerns about testing and hospital capacity in Nagasaki, which has 17 people infected, 11 of them hospitalized. Japan has about 12,000 cases, with 300 deaths.

Earlier this year, the U.S.-operated cruise Diamond Princess had 712 infected people among more than 3,700 passengers and crew while it was quarantined in Yokohama, near Tokyo. Thirteen had died amid criticism that the prolonged quarantine and inadequate measures contributed to the spread of the virus in close quarters.

Two other cruise ships, the Costa Serena and the Costa Neo Romantica, are also docked in Nagasaki with 669 and 393 crew members, respectively. Nagasaki city official Kaori Matsuo said so far there has been no report of anyone showing symptoms.

Nagasaki officials have said they plan to have the crew of the Costa Atlantica quarantine themselves on board unless they develop serious symptoms, and seek ways to let others who tested negative return to their countries.

Nagasaki is getting support from a military medical team and plans to test all the remaining crew by Friday."

The sample collected is transported under specified conditions in a viral transport medium to the testing laboratory.“The protocol for the kit uses magnetic nanoparticles to capture and concentrate the RNA from the patient sample. This is of significant advantage because even if some viral RNA disintegrates during storage and transportation of the patient samples, all of it is captured by the magnetic bead-based extraction technology,” SCTIMST, an institution of national importance under the Department of Science and Technology ( DST ), SCTIMST, said.The DST added that the magnetic nanoparticle beads bind to the viral RNA and, when exposed to a magnetic field, give a highly purified and concentrated level of RNA. “As the yield of PCR or LAMP test is dependent on getting an adequate quantity of viral RNA, this innovation enhances the chances of identifying positive cases. The Institute has filed for a patent for this technology, which is simpler than in imported kits,” DST said.The technology of Chitra Magna has been transferred to the Agappe Diagnostics Ltd in Ernakulam, which has already taken the Chitra GeneLAMP-N technology, which uses RT-LAMP for identification of the N gene of SARS-COV-2, as reported by TOI last week.Chitra Magna can be used to extract high purity RNA from patient samples not only for LAMP testing but also for the RT-PCR test. The first step of isolating high quality and high concentration of RNA without degradation is critical to the outcome of the PCR or LAMP test in which RNA is converted to DNA.“Barring a few Indian manufacturers, the majority of RNA isolation kits are imported, and its non-availability often becomes a severe bottleneck for RT-PCR testing in large numbers across the country,” the DST said.DST secretary Professor Ashutosh Sharma said that the innovative process of conjugating the RNA with magnetic nanoparticles and increasing their concentration in one place by applying a magnetic field is a breakthrough that allowed the high sensitivity of a newly developed RT-LAMP test from SCTIMST. “Indeed, multidisciplinary and lateral thinking are the hallmarks of good science, with this example fitting the bill,” he added."

Cider is on the verge of gaining a new vigor with new product launches, opening of new facilities, and its further usage in combating against coronavirus. Manufacturers have launched new products to give an innovative taste to consumers. Moreover, they are opening up new facilities to cater to increasing need and expand into new markets. The launch of new facilities also enables them to collaborate with local players and offer innovative products. With new product launches and other strategies, some of the makers try to bring back the trend of dry hard ciders in Wisconsin.Download Sample Copy Of Report@Alec Steinmetz manufactures ciders with the name Forward and aims to bring a new experience with dry ciders. In addition, on the coronavirus outbreak, market players have been utilizing cider to produce an alcohol hand sanitizer and offering them to hospitals. The market for cider is experiencing a huge growth. According to the report published by Allied Market Research, the global cider market is expected to generate $16.25 billion by 2023. Following are some of the activities going on across the world.Launching new products is one of the recent trends that market players have adopted to attract new customers and gain more share of the market. Strongbow, one of the leading players in the U.K., launched rose cider in the wake of summer. This cider does not contain artificial sweeteners, colors, and flavors. Carrot concentrates have been used to give a pinkish hue. Rachel Holms, the Brand Director at Strongbow, highlighted that Strongbow Ros? is the most successful recipe the company has ever tested. It will launch new initiatives to reach as much people as possible. Along with Strongbow, there are other brands including Magne and Kopparberg that have launched their rose ciders. Magne launched its cider in June, while Kopparberg in August of last year.Among new strategies adopted by market players to grow business, opening new production facility to scale up production is one of the strategies. This proves to be one of the smartest strategies too as it helps in fulfilling demand and add new customers by expanding into new markets with availability of stock. Bryant's Small Batch Cider from Nelson County will open up a new facility in Richmond. The facility will be based in the historic Shockoe Bottom area. The company will invest more than $250,000 for renovating the facility and plant trees on the site. The new facility will also create eight new jobs. Governor Ralph Northam outlined that the Virginia's position as the top area for artisanal ciders comes from the roots in the apple industry. The administration would help the initiatives that would create new jobs and revitalize the cities.For Purchase Enquiry at:The Richmond facility would support another small cidery in Nelson County. This new facility will be a large-scale and contain a high-capacity canning line that is suitable for distribution-focused production. Bettina Ring, the Secretary of Agriculture and Forestry, highlighted that the facility would create a new market for apple growers in rural areas along with offering Richmond residents and other consumers to taste the apples of Virginia through the ciders. Jerry Thornton, the owner of new facility stated that the manufacturing space would enable the firm to partner with local artisans and produce innovative and tasty ciders on regular basis.In the wake of outbreak of coronavirus, there are various strategies adopted by market players to make mark in the industry. Among those strategies, shipping ciders to doorsteps of consumers is another strategy. Nine Pin Ciderworks, the first New York's farm cidery from New York, adopted the strategy of shipping its hard cider to the doorsteps of consumers in the New York State. The New York State Liquor Authority gave permission owing to coronavirus outbreak. Consumers can place order through the website of the company and there is no minimum amount for placing the order. The order will be fulfilled in 48 hours.A Cornish cider company is also taking an important step to compact the spread of coronavirus. It has been manufacturing hand sanitizers and distributing in hospitals for free. Healeys Cornish Cider Farm has been making hand sanitizers upon the request by Royal Cornwall Hospital. The company produces nearly 100 liters of sanitizer per week by following the guidelines and recipes of the World Health Organization (WHO).Key Players: Anheuser-Busch Companies LLC, Asahi Premium Beverages, Aston Manor, C&C Group plc, Carlsberg Breweries A/S, Carlton & United Breweries (CUB), Distell, Halewood, Heineken UK Limited, and The Boston Beer Company.Obtain Report Details:Contact:David Correa5933 NE Win Sivers Drive#205, Portland, OR 97220United StatesUSA/Canada (Toll Free): 1-800-792-5285, 1-503-894-6022, 1-503-446-1141UK: +44-845-528-1300Hong Kong: +852-301-84916India (Pune): +91-20-66346060Fax: +1(855)550-5975help@alliedmarketresearch.comWeb:Follow Us on LinkedIn:About Us:Allied Market Research (AMR) is a full-service market research and business-consulting wing of Allied Analytics LLP based in Portland, Oregon.

For weeks federal officials have raised alarms about the dangers of exposure to the virus in their effort to persuade Americans to stay at home.

President Donald Trump is now aiming for a swift nationwide reopening and with that comes the challenge of convincing people it will be safe to resume their normal lives.

At the White House, officials believe they've entered a new chapter of the pandemic response, moving from crisis mode to sustained mitigation and management.

For Trump, his reelection likely rides on the pace of an economic rebound."

The fire broke out in a third-floor unit at the building on George Street, between Richmond and Adelaide streets, at around 10:23 a.m.

According to Toronto Fire, it extended into an adjacent unit and then spread up to a fourth-floor balcony.

Images sent to CP24 showed visible flames on a balcony and thick, black smoke pouring into the air was visible for kilometres around.

“Upon arrival the crews were met with heavy smoke and flame. They initiated an aggressive fire attack and the fire was quickly knocked down,”Division Commander Colin Giffin told CP24 at the scene.

He said the decision was made to add a third alarm to make sure there were additional resources if necessary.

“From outside there was a lot of flame and a lot of smoke and obviously with a multi-unit residential building and with the COVID-19 situation, there could be a lot of occupants at home and the decision was made to escalate it to a third alarm,” Giffin said.

No occupants were found inside the affected units following a search by firefighters, Giffin said.

The fire sent panicked residents who were home due to the COVID-19 pandemic fleeing zoom meetings and yoga sessions to escape the burning building.

“I was having a zoom meeting with the workforce and I look to my left and it’s dark outside. There’s literally a wall of black smoke,” one resident who identified himself as Rob told CP24.

He said the fire alarm started to go off and that’s when he fled. Despite the panic, he said residents still made an effort to maintain social distancing as best as possible.

“Down the stairs was good. People were still keeping their distance. That’s the vibe. Still, everyone was very orderly and everyone just knew we were all in this together, trying to get outside as fast as possible,” he said. “They were trying. They were doing their best. They were doing everything they could but obviously it’s an emergency situation and they were trying their best.”

Another resident, Sheila, said she lives on the eighth floor, but the smoke outside her window led her to believe the fire was right below her.

“I was actually on a video call with my manager and I thought it was a false alarm,” she said, clutching her small dog outside the building. “I went outside to my balcony and there was just black everywhere. Panic struck and I told my dog ‘we gotta go.’

“I grabbed his leash and we ran out the door with just the most important thing, which is myself and him. But we’re all safe, so I’m happy.”

Another resident said she was in the middle of an online yoga session when she had to flee.

It’s not yet clear what caused the fire.

“It is very early. Our operations are almost done. We are in the middle of ventilating the smoke from the building,” Giffin said. “We do have our fire investigation division on route and they will be doing a thorough investigation, as well as an audit of the building for fire safety.”

The fire comes just a day after Fire Chief Matthew Pegg, in the wake of a fatal house fire in Etobicoke, urged residents to practice proper fire safety at home. He said the most common causes of fires in Toronto are unattended cooking and smokers’ materials.

No injuries were reported in connection with the highrise fire."

Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's administration sent notices to 2,903 workers in state agencies informing them of layoffs starting Sunday for 10 work days over two different pay periods.

Additionally, Attorney General Dana Nessel is temporarily laying off 100 employees in her department.

The temporary layoffs affect just a fraction of the 48,000-employee state workforce and are estimated to save the state's general fund $5 million this fiscal year, according to the State Budget Office.

State employees laid off will retain their health insurance and other benefits and ""will be automatically enrolled into the unemployment process to help ensure that they have the support they need during this challenging time,"" Whitmer said.

""I've mentioned that I've made a lot of hard choices in the past six weeks — this was one of the hardest,"" Whitmer said Wednesday at a news conference in Lansing. ""But this is the right thing to do to ensure that we can continue providing critical services to the people of Michigan.""

Earlier this week, Whitmer said she's voluntarily forgoing 10 percent of her $159,300 annual salary this fiscal year and that she's directing her senior staff to take a 5 percent pay cut through Sept. 30.

Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson laid off 929 of her department's employees, about 60 percent of her workforce who can't perform their jobs from home. The layoffs are mostly hitting Secretary of State branch workers, according to Benson's office.

""This decision was not easy, but is necessary to responsibly steward taxpayer funds at this time,"" Benson said in a statement.

The Secretary of State's office has the most temporary layoffs of any state department, followed by 428 in the Department of Corrections, 279 in the Treasury Department, 264 in the Department of Natural Resources and 201 employees in the 14,000-employee Department of Health and Human Services, according to the state Office of the State Employer.

The layoffs in the Attorney General's office amount to 25 percent of the workforce in the state's law department.

""While certain areas of the department's legal work have dramatically increased as a result of this emergency, other areas have slowed,"" Nessel spokeswoman Kelly Rossman-McKinney told the Associated Press.

The governor was asked Wednesday by a reporter whether the layoffs will be enough to reduce spending given that there are estimates of a budget deficit of at least $1.5 billion this fiscal year.

""This crisis has taken an economic toll on household budgets, on local government budgets, on the state budget, on business budgets,"" Whitmer said. ""We are all going to have to navigate this to the best of our ability and protect as many people in the process."""

394,394,https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/news/new-plymouth-domestic-abuse-helpline-4069668,New Plymouth domestic abuse helpline gets Government recognition,Special domestic abuse helpline which puts Devon and Cornwall teachers in touch with psychologists to help them support child victims has drawn the attention of ministers,www.plymouthherald.co.uk,"A Plymouth-borne charity which supports child victims of domestic violence has drawn the attention of the Government for its creation of a special helpline for teachers working in Devon and Cornwall schools during the coronavirus lockdown.

Operation Encompass was the brainchild of former Devonport police sergeant David Carney-Haworth and his wife, Torpoint Nursery and Infants school headteacher Elisabeth.

The scheme, launched in 2011, ensured that information gathered by police at the scene of a domestic incident where children were present, was passed onto that child’s school before 9am the following morning

The scheme ensured that key staff at the school, such as that child’s teacher, were able to put in place measures to support the youngster from the moment they arrived.

After the lockdown was announced there were concerns that the Operation Encompass scheme would be hampered, but Devon and Cornwall Police's Chief Constable Shaun Sawyer announced that domestic abuse was a priority issue for his officers and that the forwarding of key information to schools would continue.

Earlier this month the couple - with the help of funding from the Devon and Cornwall Police and Crime Commissioner Alison Hernandez - launched a free helpline which allows teachers who are continuing to work with children who have been victims of domestic abuse to call child and educational psychologists or clinical psychologists who can offer important advice and guidance.

No information about the child, other than the circumstances, is shared an the calls are entirely anonymous and confidential.

David Carney-Haworth told Plymouth Live the Operation Encompass scheme sees the police force's Central Safeguarding Team (CST) passing on information to schools about a child who has been present during a domestic abuse incident where police had attended.

For those children who were not currently attending school because they did not fall into any of the government's identified groups, the CST would still share information with the school as normal as this would assist a school in evaluating a child’s vulnerability.

Recognising that the current situation meant that some teachers were working with children they had never taught before, or were teaching at other schools within their multi-academy set-ups, David and Lis noted that there was a risk some teachers were left unsure of how to support a child after the school received an Operation Encompass call.

As a result the Teachers' Helpline was launched on April 1 and operates from 8.30am to 10am, from Monday to Friday, staffed by a child and educational psychologist or clinical psychologist from Psychology Associates.

The number - 07562250050 - is available for all teachers of any age of child across all of Devon and Cornwall. Thanks to the funding from the Crime Commissioner, there is no charge to the teacher or school for the specialist professional advice.

Following an announcement from the Chancellor Rishi Sunak that the Government would offer a funding package for charities - in particular £360m for organisations providing vital frontline services, including those supporting survivors of domestic abuse, the Operation Encompass charity put in a bid to extend the Teacher's Helpline scheme.

David said: ""We received a call from the Department of Education's lead safeguarding team who had been alerted to our work by the Home Office.

""They were quite enthusiastic and positive about it and said it had been looked at by a minister.

""Our suggestion was that if this scheme is good enough for Devon and Cornwall children, then it's good enough for children across the nation.""

Over the last few years the scheme has been rolled out by the majority of police forces across the country, including Devon and Cornwall, and last year won the overall World Class Policing Award.

It has received praise and plaudits from royalty, Childline creator Dame Esther Rantzen and Victims Commissioner Dave Vera Baird QC as well as the Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services' (HMICFRS).

Last June the couple were both awarded OBE's for their work safeguarding children from domestic abuse.

David said: ""A large number of police forces across the country already have Operation Encompass set up - it makes sense to us that what teachers - and the children who are victims of domestic abuse - are experiencing in Devon and Cornwall is mirror right across the country.

""Shouldn't all those children and all those teachers be able to get the same support? A teacher in Essex or Yorkshire who is trying to support a child who has experienced domestic abuse, in the middle of lockdown, could benefit from speaking to a child or clinical psychologist for advice. It could make such a difference in supporting that child, especially as there has been a marked increased in incidents of domestic abuse.

""We told the Home Office what we were already doing in Devon and Cornwall and we believe it has potential to go further. They were very enthusiastic and agreed. They called the Department of Education and they were also really enthusiastic.

""This helpline is to support the teachers in Devon and Cornwall who are also feeling isolated. Some are not in their normal classes or even their same schools. We also know that this is happening in all the other force areas.

""The Chief Constable, Shaun Sawyer, told all his frontline staff when they attend an incident of domestic abuse where children are present they have to think 'Operation Encompass'.

""Both the Department of Education and the Home Office has responded enthusiastically to making the Teacher's Helpline a national helpline and we know the Home Office minister has been involved in this conversation.""

David said the aim was to ensure the helpline lasted longer than the period of the lockdown and potentially as long as 12 months, explaining that the effects on children who are victims of domestic abuse may not present themselves for some time afterwards.

He said: ""The helpline would be made available for up to a year with the hope that this would become a permanent helpline for teachers.

""If it can be established nationally, then why wouldn't a teacher use it to get support for their schoolchildren? It would be free support for all teachers to engage confidentially with a clinical psychologist to best support a child who has been victim of domestic abuse at home.""

Lis Carney-Haworth said she fully recognises the difficulties teachers face regarding children who are victims and particularly during lockdown, away from the usual safe haven of school, away from their peers and any possible pastoral care, unable even to go outside for any length of time for respite.

She said: ""When children who have suffered weeks, perhaps months, of domestic abuse finally go back to school they are going to be incredibly damaged children.

""The impact on them will not disappear overnight, or in a few days or weeks. This is why we've asked for the Teacher's Helpline to keep running for a year and potentially even longer.

""In many ways this is the greatest social experiment British families have ever faced. Children learn through social interaction - not social isolation. A child, trapped at home, suffering domestic abuse day after day, for months, with no access to help or support - the implications are scary. Those children will not be the same when they finally go back to school and they - and the teachers - deserve this support when they finally do."""

The “vast majority” of the new cases are work permit holders residing in foreign worker dormitories, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said in its preliminary release of figures.

More than 1,000 foreign workers, including Indian nationals, are among 1,016 new COVID-19 cases confirmed in Singapore on Wednesday noon, according to official figures. Fifteen coronavirus cases are Singaporeans or permanent residents among the Wednesday confirmed infections.

“We are still working through the details of the cases, and further updates will be shared via the MOH press release that will be issued tonight,” the ministry added.

Foreign workers in Singapore – many of them Indian nationals – have been hit hard by the virus, with several foreign worker dormitories being placed under quarantine.

The city-state managed to keep its outbreak in check in the early stages due to widespread testing and contact-tracing, but is facing a fast-moving second wave of infections.

Singapore has further closed businesses after Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Tuesday extended the “circuit breaker” until June 1 to control the spread of the deadly disease. Speaking in Chinese on Tuesday circuit break extension announcement, the prime minister said that only one person from each household should be away from home at any one time.

He urged people to stay at home as much as possible. Should they need to go out for the essentials, they should do so alone, he stressed.

 “Go out alone, get what you need, and return home straightaway,” said the prime minister. “Do your marketing on weekdays rather than weekends, and don’t bring your whole family with you for grocery shopping.”

Additional measures on food and retail outlets took effect from Wednesday and will continue until at least May 4 which means more workplaces will be closed, reducing the number of workers who keep essential services going. All standalone food and beverage outlets selling mainly drinks and snacks, as well as hairdressing and barber shops, were asked to shut by 11.59 pm on Tuesday night, reported The Straits Times.

Entry restrictions have been imposed at popular markets while temperature screening is being done on every visitor at all supermarkets and malls from Wednesday.

Visitors to these public places will also have to provide their particulars for contact tracing, the Ministry of Trade and Industry said on Tuesday night.

397,397,https://www.nyasatimes.com/mcp-utm-alliance-warn-govt-dont-throw-malawi-into-anarchy-over-covid-19/,MCP-UTM alliance warn govt ‘don’t throw Malawi into anarchy’ over Covid-19,"Malawi breaking news publishing 24 hours a day news about Malawi, Malawi Business, Malawi Tourism, Malawi Politics, Malawi News",www.nyasatimes.com,"Malawi Congress Party (MCP) and its electoral partner, UTM, have warned government that will take the blame if Malawians take the law into their hands in protest against the proposed nationwide lockdown to prevent further spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19).

The MCP-UTM alliance and its partners argue that President Peter Mutharika is resisting to comply with the law on lockdown; hence, government must not expect citizens to respect the law when leaders are failing to lead by example.

A statement the alliance issued on Thursday and made available to Nyasa Times argues that any responsible lockdown must be preceded by material and financial support to those most adversely affected by restrictions on movement and disruptions to livelihood.

“Similarly, on April 8, a whole week before the lockdown order, Dr. Saulos Chilima (UTM leader) outlined the various groups that need support to survive the lockdown. Sadly, neither warning was heeded, leaving Malawians from north to south with no choice, but rush to the streets to protest this glaring oversight.

“As we speak, the material and financial support to vulnerable and impoverished Malawians has still not been given. If any Malawians suffer hunger and loss of income due to a lockdown, it will be because the Mutharika administration refused to heed this advice,” reads a statement, which has been signed by MCP Secretary General Reverend Maurice Munthali and his UTM counterpart Dr Joseph Chidanti Malunga.

Munthali and Malunga say the MCP/UTM alliance and its partners were therefore not surprised that even the Malawi Law Society (MLS) faulted the government for failing to comply with the provisions of the Disaster Preparedness and Relief Act under which its declaration of disaster was made as well as for misapplying the provisions of the Public Health Act under which its lockdown rules were formulated.

They says the Mutharika administration’s incompetence in matters of the law has once again not only landed it in trouble with the courts, but has also put it in danger of violating the Constitution for any lockdown would involve the abrogation of people’s constitutional rights, including the right to freely and safely vote for a president of their choice in the fresh election to be held within the next 70 days as ordered by the Constitutional Court.

“The Constitution only allows such abrogation of rights in a State of Emergency during times of war and natural disaster, which means that for such abrogation of rights to apply to a State of Disaster, Parliament would have to first amend the Constitution or pass emergency legislation, which Government has not bothered to do, leaving the State open to lawsuits for acting ultra vires,” Munthali and Malunga say in the statement.

“If lawlessness and anarchy ensue in the land in the wake of this pandemic, it will be because the Mutharika Administration itself refused to comply with the law,” they warn.

The MCP/UTM Alliance further expresses dismay to learn that the Minister of Finance has written to commercial banks asking for a moratorium on loan repayments for parliamentarians, yet it did not extend the relief to nurses and doctors who ought to be exempted from income tax until this storm passes.

The two parties believe say it is these acts of neglect towards health workers that have caused them to stage sit-ins and suspend health services across the country.

“What government needs to do is simply act on their demands, not dismiss them as unreasonable. If any of our medical facilities and personnel are overrun by COVID-19 cases, it will be because the Mutharika administration refused to attend to their needs.

“Remarkably, only one of the measures was implemented, namely the closure of schools and restrictions on public gatherings. The rest have largely been ignored, beginning with the closure of our borders and all points of entry,” the statement further reads.

The opposition alliance observed that equally ignored is the provision and requirement of mandatory masks for everyone going outside their home and mandatory hand-washing at all facilities."

• The lastest flash PMI data from the Commonwealth Bank shows the economy is shrinking quickly.
• On a scale of 100, where any score below 50 shows a contraction, Australia scored just 22.4 in April.
• That’s sharply down from nearly 40 the previous month, indicating the “profound negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic”, according to CBA head of Australian economics Gareth Aird.

The Australian economy is deep into one hell of a contraction.

Not only is it well on its way to a recession, but the latest flash PMI data shows the rate at which the country is racing into one has only sped up in recent weeks.

PMI reflects how demand has changed within different sectors, with a score below 50 demonstrating an overall economic contraction. Australia’s PMI now sits at just 22.4, having “collapsed” in April by 17 points, according to the Commonwealth Bank head of Australian economics.

“The profound negative impact of the COVID‑19 pandemic on the Australian economy has been reflected in the incredible collapse in the CBA Flash Composite PMI over April,” Gareth Aird said in a note issued to Business Insider Australia. “Indeed the overall result is simply astonishing.”

The extraordinary score is reflective of the extraordinary effort to quash the COVID-19 outbreak, as Australia shuts down entire sectors, restricts the operation of businesses and the movement of individuals, and generally dampens consumer demand. What the data shows unsurprisingly is that those businesses that rely on close personal contact are reeling more than others.

“The services sector has been hit a lot harder than the manufacturing sector as evidenced by the disparity between the overall levels of the Manufacturing PMI [at] 45.6, compared to the Services PMI [of] 19.6,” Aird said.

The size of the contraction is sure to be felt most strongly in the eastern states, where the likes of New South Wales and Victoria rely heavily on a services industry that has been quickly shedding jobs.

It’s not to say manufacturing has come out unscathed. While falling wages and fuel prices have cut the cost of doing business for the service sector, countervailing winds have buffeted manufacturers.

“It was a different outcome for the manufacturing sector as input costs lifted due to the fall in the Aussie dollar and reported shortages of materials,” Aird said.

In sum, it’s shaping up to be a rough economic hibernation for Australia."

The Prime Minister has now announced the country will move to alert level 3[1] from Tuesday 28 April. In light of this, the Chief Justice Helen Winkelmann has announced the following changes to the way New Zealand’s courts will be operating:

The courts will be open to the public. However, to ensure safe working conditions for court staff, counsel, and the public, there will be limits on the numbers who can attend. Priority will be given to those who have business at court.

The type and volume of work in the courts will continue to expand. This will involve a mixture of in-person hearings, hearings in which some participants may appear remotely, and virtual hearings in which no one, other than a registrar, may be in a courtroom.

Courts will conduct judge-alone trials involving witnesses, who may be required to attend court. However, jury trials remain suspended until 31 July 2020.

Courts continue to be cleaned to the higher standards introduced at the start of the pandemic. Hand sanitiser will be readily available. Court participants may wear their own PPE such as gloves and masks if they wish.

Where feasible, counsel and witnesses are permitted to participate remotely.

Descriptions of filing arrangements for each court, and the work that will be heard at alert level 3 are set out in each court’s protocol available on the Courts of New Zealand website. Counters remain closed and physical drop boxes will be provided for urgent documents that are delivered by hand.

Accredited media continue to have access to the courts during all alert levels including remote hearings. Detailed information for media is available on the Courts of New Zealand website."

The Central region has reported the most cases with more than 4,000, followed by the West region and the Southeast region.

Of the 857 deaths, Mexico City has reported 224, followed by Baja California with 100.

The Undersecretary of Prevention and Health Promotion, Hugo López-Gatell Ramírez, announced (computer translated) the start of Phase 3 due to the epidemic of COVID-19 in Mexico, during the morning conference at the National Palace, led by the President of the Republic, Andrés Manuel López Obrador.

Faced with this stage, he reported that yesterday the General Health Council (CSG), chaired by the Secretary of Health, Jorge Alcocer Varela, approved various control actions, after the evidence of the characteristics was exposed before this body of this stage: active outbreaks and spread in the territory with more than a thousand cases, as well as the recommendations of the scientific groups.

Among the measures approved, the following stand out: the extension of the National Sana Distancia Day until May 30, and the extension until that date, of the suspension of non-essential activities, in order to mitigate the spread and transmission of the SARS-CoV virus- 2 in the community, to reduce the burden of disease, its complications and death from COVID-19 in the population residing in the national territory.

The mechanisms are those that are arranged, and it is the temporary suspension of all non-essential work activity in the public, private and social sectors. It is national in scope and must be enforced at the local level, he stressed.

He specified that private entities that continue to work and are not on the essential list, must suspend activities so that people do not have to attend the workplace and, as far as possible, do work at home.

López-Gatell Ramírez explained that activities in all public spaces such as cinemas, theaters, parks, squares and beaches are also suspended, as an effective mechanism of healthy distance.

If those municipalities where there is low or no transmission remain at that level until the date close to May 30, an early limitation of healthy distance measures may be made.

The date of up to May 17 has been raised, with a reopening on May 18, if the municipalities that today are with low transmission remain with low transmission.

Any smaller event requires attendees to maintain a distance of two metres from one another.

“We need to remember that a single case of COVID-19 can spread like wildfire in large groups of people,” Hinshaw said in a Thursday update. “I know summer festivals and events are incredibly important for many people. They provide fun and entertainment in every part of our province, and many people depend on them for livelihood.”

“This decision was not made lightly, but we must do everything we can to prevent the spread of COVID-19.”

Many local summer events had already announced their postponement or cancellation, including the Grande Prairie Stompede and the Bear Creek Folk Festival. Hinshaw said this announcement was to provide clarification for events still waiting to decide whether or not to proceed.

She warned that festivals and other large events have the potential to become “super-spreader events” where one sick person can expose many individuals to the novel coronavirus.

In addition, Albertans are advised against going to their summer homes, while all public health orders and recommendations still apply for outside activities.

“While we are all eager for a relaunch and want to see an easing of restrictions, now is not the time to have people moving through the province and possibly unknowingly spread the virus,” Hinshaw said.

“This virus has taken many things from us, and this is one more loss to absorb.”

The province will monitor the pandemic over the summer before deciding on events for September and beyond.

The MD of Smoky River and Mackenzie County each have a new case, but no new deaths were reported for the Peace region.

As of Thursday, the cases per area for the Peace region are as follows:
• County of GP: Five cases (four active, one recovered)
• MD of Greenview: Two cases (one active, one recovered)
• MD of Peace: Seven cases (one active, six recovered)
• MD of Lesser Slave Lake: Five cases (one active, four recovered)

Saddle Hills County, the MD of Spirit River, Birch Hills County and the MD of Fairview have no confirmed cases of COVID-19 as of Thursday.

Alberta has confirmed 319 new cases for a total of 3,720 with 1,357 recoveries.

Two more deaths were reported for Alberta and were both in Brooks. A total of 68 deaths related to COVID-19 have occurred in the province, although the official report will only read 67 deaths as of Thursday as one case was only recently confirmed."

SINGAPORE (Reuters) – Pastor Samuel Gift Stephen spends his days trying to ensure migrant workers in Singapore, confined to cramped dormitories due to an outbreak of coronavirus, all remain well fed.

He runs one of a number of non-governmental organisations working with authorities and employers to deliver meals to dormitories where workers are either under government quarantine or ordered to stay home to curb transmission of the disease.

Singapore has seen a sharp rise in COVID-19 cases to over 10,000 infections this week, the vast majority from dormitories where workers mainly from Bangladesh and India live in bunk rooms each housing 12 to 20 men.

The government has said employers are required to provide sufficient food for workers during this lockdown period, but it is also working with NGOs like Stephen’s Alliance of Guest Workers Outreach (AGWO) to make up any shortfalls.

“Employers are supposed to provide catered food to their employees. And the truth to the matter is that…some of them don’t have the muscle power, they don’t have the financial power because of this financial crunch,” Stephen, chairman of AGWO, said as he unloaded bags of plastic containers from the back of a van to dormitories on Wednesday.

The mainly South Asian workers receiving the meals, many wearing traditional lungis wrapped around their waists, stood nearby queuing up to see health workers wearing masks, blue scrubs and plastic shields covering their faces.

Dormitories with large numbers of infections have been put under government-ordered quarantines in recent weeks, and on Tuesday the government said all foreign construction workers must stay home for two weeks.

Stephen said his organisation arranges for caterers to cook and deliver meals at least twice a day for certain dormitories – an initiative funded by charitable donations. The Ministry of Manpower has previously said that NGOs like AGWO are helping deliver 7,000 meals a day to workers.

Dormitory operators have welcomed the initiative, which they say is helping them over a difficult period.

“We have contacted all the employers to try to ensure that their meals and daily essentials have been taken care of. At the same time, we reached out to charity organisations…to help supplement whatever there is shortfall,” said Eugene Aw, director of RT Group, which manages several factory-converted migrant dormitories, including one visited by AGWO on Wednesday.

“Because the ramping-up period takes a bit of time for all these demands to be met on a daily basis.”"

This question is the second installment of B/R's ""What If?"" college football series. Last week, Kerry Miller theorized the effect Joe Burrow would've had if he'd remained at Ohio State instead of leaving for LSU.

As a freshman in 2016, Herbert became the starter midway through the season. Although the Ducks trudged to a 4-8 record—the program's worst finish in 25 years—Herbert provided optimism with 19 touchdowns and just four interceptions.

He missed five games in 2017 because of a broken collarbone, yet he continued to impress scouts and evaluators.

Before the 2018 season, Herbert was widely labeled a top draft-eligible quarterback. In early rankings, he stood atop the position for B/R's Matt Miller and ESPN's Mel Kiper Jr., among others. Given that perception and the reality of modern star players typically leaving for the NFL as soon as they're eligible, it seemed Herbert would depart for the NFL.

Though we're focused on the impact on college football, the New York Giants undoubtedly would have considered Herbert at No. 6. They ended up selecting Duke's Daniel Jones to replace Eli Manning.

As for Oregon, backup quarterback Braxton Burmeister transferred to Virginia Tech last offseason. He replaced an injured Herbert in 2017 but only entered a few lopsided games in 2018. Had he stayed and Herbert left, Oregon would've held a competition between Burmeister and Tyler Shough.

The simple truth is, in all likelihood, the Ducks wouldn't have enjoyed such a productive 2019. While it's plausible they could've won a mediocre Pac-12 North thanks to a spectacular defense, a 10-win season is a fair best-case scenario.

But a Herbert-less Oregon means Utah would've had a better chance at reaching the College Football Playoff.

Entering the Pac-12 Championship Game, Utah ranked No. 5 nationally, one spot ahead of Oklahoma. Because of Oregon's win, however, an Oklahoma victory over Baylor propelled the Sooners to the CFP.

Yes, LSU wrecked Oklahoma anyway. Utah probably would've encountered a similar fate—though a stronger secondary means it maybe would've been a bit less lopsided. Besides, an invitation to the dance is a whole lot better than watching it from the outside.

Oklahoma would've been disappointed to miss the CFP, for sure. But since the Sooners are an established perennial power, merely being the nation's fifth-best team wouldn't have affected their Big 12 dominance or future outlook.

What a difference it could've made for Utah, though.

Simply appearing in the CFP would have bolstered the program's appeal to top recruits around the country.

Utah joined the Pac-12 in 2011 and has consistently hovered in the 30-50 range of 247Sports' recruiting rankings. It's possible to succeed without elite talent. It's also exceptionally rare to build—and sustain—a true national contender without elite talent.

Even as the Utes signed a program-best 29th-ranked class in 2020, the 2021 cycle would've been more likely to bring their first-ever top-25 haul.

Maybe it will happen anyway! Utah has back-to-back Pac-12 South titles and five nine-win seasons in the last six years, after all. But a 38-10 loss to Texas in the Alamo Bowl is a markedly less exciting pitch than ""We made the College Football Playoff last year.""

Even with a CFP appearance, 2020 would be a rebuilding year for Utah. But a six- to eight-win season would be easier to sell as a temporary setback had the Utes headed to the playoff.

Herbert's return may have stalled the emergence of a Pac-12 power."

The Australian Government’s controversial app will store users’ personal information in a central database hosted by US tech giant Amazon, it was confirmed today.

But Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the database would be hosted on servers within Australia and it would be “illegal” for the multibillion-dollar company to use the information for any other purpose than for what it was originally intended.

The national contract to store the details of Australian app users and coronavirus carriers was awarded to the Seattle-based firm after an invitation-only tender organised by the Department of Home Affairs.

The Digital Transformation Agency, which has taken over the project, also confirmed it would store decryption keys for the information on the same servers as the information itself, even though security experts advise against this practice.

It’s understood the decryption keys will be protected by Amazon software.

The app, which is due to be released within weeks, will be based on Singapore’s TraceTogether app, and will use Bluetooth beacons to track whether users have been within 1.5m of one another for 15 minutes or longer.

If an app user is later diagnosed with COVID-19, state-based health officials will use information gathered by the app to identify and notify their close contacts.

Mr Morrison said the app would be released “soon,” but added “there are still some issues we’re working through”.

He said the Federal Government had worked with Amazon “on many, many sensitive issues” in the past.

But Optus Macquarie University Cyber Security Hub executive director Dali Kaafar said the decision to host this information offshore with a foreign company would not help to allay fears about user privacy.“This will likely raise more concerns or more questions,” he said.

“That will be also an important tool for the country as we seek to manage how we live in a COVID-safe economy and community into the future,” he said.

“And the rapid response to individual outbreaks - we should be aware, as a community right across the country, that when we take further steps to ease restrictions, of course, we will continue to see outbreaks. That is to be expected. What matters is being able to move on them quickly.”

The national cabinet, which met this morning, has also agreed to put in place national principles to guide the resumption of sport and recreation, including at a professional level.

“So, the major sporting codes, our Olympic sports, training arrangements that sit around support for those activities, by elite sportspeople,” he said.

“Secondly, at the community competitive sport level. That is such an important part of our way of life here in Australia, and the principles that can help guide decisions by states and territories in the future.

“And, thirdly, at the individual passive level of sport and recreation. Activities from everything from - whether it’s in the shire, if you’re going surfing, or if you’re walking in the local national park, or whatever it might happen to be, those set of principles that states and territories can draw on in terms of getting some consistency across the country as we move into this next phase.”

And national safe workplace principles have also been locked in, with Mr Morrison saying his focus was on getting Australians back to work.

“This is all about getting Australians back to work, and ensuring that when they go back to work that they and their families can feel safe in going back to work, and to ensure that there are important principles in place, there are protocols and procedures that, should a COVID case present in a workplace, then the rules that people need to follow...,” he said.

Schools do not have to keep children 1.5 metres apart, the national cabinet has agreed.

Mr Morrison said the national medical expert panel had confirmed the social distancing measure - along with one person per four square metres - did not apply in classrooms for kids.

Aged care homes face having to seek approval for locking down their facilities, with Prime Minister Scott Morrison declaring he will not cop “having people stuck in their rooms, not being able to be visited by their loved ones and carers and other support people.”

“That’s not okay,” the PM told reporters this afternoon. “We are not going to have these as secret places, where people can’t access them.”

Shutting off homes was only valid if there was a “very real and serious medical reason”, as had been the case in parts of northwest Tasmania and western Sydney, Mr Morrison said.

Mr Morrison said he, along with the state and territory leaders, were “concerned about restrictions beyond the baseline requirements of what National Cabinet has agreed, based on the expert medical advice.”

“Should we not see an improvement in this area, under the voluntary arrangements that we currently have in place,” he said, “the Commonwealth would be moving to require aged care facilities that wish to have an exemption to those national principles, those national arrangements, then they would need to seek authority to do that from the Commonwealth, and we would make such a decision in consultation with the relevant state and territory jurisdiction.

“We would very much like to keep these things on a basis where aged care facilities are exercising their proper discretion,” he said.

One week after the national cabinet agreed to a four-week timeline to consider easing restrictions in the middle of May, Mr Morrison said: “Good progress is being made on the core requirements ... that will enable our road back.”

Testing regimes are being expanded across the states and territories, which he said was a “very important pillar” to deal with the virus in the future.

New modelling, released by the Prime Minister and Chief Medical Officer Professor Brendan Murphy, shows the effective reproduction rate remains below one - meaning each infected patient is spreading the virus to fewer than one other person on average.

Prof Murphy said the country needed to be “incredibly vigilant” about outbreaks - like the one seen in Victoria today.

The national cabinet will meet again next Friday.

US President Donald Trump has suggested the possibility of using UV light and injecting disinfectant into a coronavirus patient to try and see if it will help them recover.

President Trump made the comment at a White House briefing after Bill Bryan, a Department of Homeland Security official who gave a presentation on research his team had undertaken.

It revealed the virus does not live as long in warmer and more humid temperatures.

Bryan said “the virus dies quickest in sunlight,” and Trump suggested one may be able to bring the light “inside the body.”

“So supposing we hit the body with a tremendous — whether it’s ultraviolet or just a very powerful light — and I think you said that hasn’t been checked because of the testing,” he said to Bryan in front of reporters.

“And then I said supposing you brought the light inside the body, which you can do either through the skin or some other way and I think you said you’re going to test that too.”

Trump then went on to say: “I see the disinfectant that knocks it out in a minute, one minute. And is there a way we can do something like that by injection inside or almost a cleaning. As you see it gets in the lungs, it does a tremendous number on the lungs, so it would be interesting to check that.”

Finance Minister Mathias Cormann has ruled out any tax increases in response to the coronavirus-induced economic storm.

The government is considering wide-ranging reform in the October federal budget, which shapes as a crucial juncture in the national recovery.

“Tax increases are off the table because you don’t want to make it harder for businesses to be successful,” Senator Cormann told Sky News on Friday.

It comes as leaders will examine Australia’s very low rate of coronavirus transmissions amid further discussions about the plan for lifting social restrictions.

After the first week of a four-week holding pattern, Prime Minister Scott Morrison says things are looking good.

“We are on the road back - and that is demonstrated by the measures that we already have taken - and we are on the way back to a COVID-safe economy as well,” he told reporters on Thursday.

National cabinet will consider the latest Australian modelling when it meets today.

While the data pool is still small given Australia’s success in containing the virus, deputy chief medical officer Nick Coatsworth said experts were able to draw sound scientific conclusions from it.

The transmission rate is one of the main pillars governments and their health advisors are looking at as they seek to map out the way forward. The other crucial steps are ensuring hospital capacity and medical supplies, and boosting tracing and testing regimes.

The number of people allowed to be at events is likely to be considered in the first round of easing restrictions.

A northern Chinese city went into lockdown after local officials claim a New York University student brought the coronavirus when she returned home from the US, according to reports.

Harbin, which has a population of 10 million, restricted travel on Wednesday after the 22-year-old graduate student was accused of sparking a local outbreak that ultimately infected at least 70 people.

The student, who was only identified by her last name, Han, returned from New York to her hometown on March 19, according to the Harbin Center for Disease Control and Prevention.

Han went through a 14-day quarantine during which she showed no symptoms and tested negative for the virus, the Chinese outlet Southern Urban Daily reported. She was also cleared by an antibody test, which would have shown past infection.

But health officials believe she was a “silent carrier,” spreading the virus to her neighbor by contaminating the building, according to the New York Post. She later was found to have antibodies of the virus in two separate tests.

Meanwhile, her neighbor was believed to have spread the virus to an 87-year-old man, who held a gathering where others became sick, the outlet reported.

The elderly man was hospitalised twice for the virus, possibly infecting others during these stints, the report said.

Health officials claimed the man has been linked to at least 78 cases, which include relatives, patients and their families, and medical professionals, according to the report.

Harbin, which is the capital of Heilongjiang, ordered inbound traffic restricted Wednesday to contain the spread of the highly contagious disease, state media said.

The city banned entry to residential zones by non-locals and vehicles registered elsewhere.

Harbin has already ordered 28 days of quarantine for anyone arriving from outside China or other identified hotspots.

“All confirmed cases, suspected cases, close contacts of asymptomatic people, and close contacts of close contacts should be quarantined and tested,” the city government said, according to state media.

ONE IN FIVE NEW YORKERS ‘INFECTED WITH CORONAVIRUS’

More than one in five New Yorkers may have already had the new coronavirus, a testing sample showed on Thursday (local time), suggesting infections are much higher than confirmed cases suggest.

Widespread testing — including for antibodies — is viewed as key to American states being able to lift stay-at-home orders and reopen their shuttered economies.

The presence of antibodies means a person has already been infected with the virus and might mean they are immune, meaning they could likely return to work without catching the illness again.

A total of 3000 customers at supermarkets across the state of New York were randomly tested for coronavirus antibodies this week, Governor Andrew Cuomo said.

Almost 14 per cent of them registered positive, he told reporters. In New York City, 21 per cent of tests came back positive.

Those would translate to roughly 2.6 million people statewide and around 1.7 million people in the Big Apple as having already had the new coronavirus.

Those numbers are way above the 263,460 declared cases across New York State, the epicentre of America’s outbreak, where the virus has killed more than 15,500 people.

“It’s vital for any state, I believe, to first get a baseline study of where you are on the infection rate,” Gov. Cuomo said.

There are uncertainties about the accuracy of antibody tests and the sample was small. But Gov. Cuomo noted that, if the data played out across the state it would mean that the death rate for COVID-19 there was only 0.5 per cent.

That is much lower than the US average and the worst-affected countries in Europe, which are based on confirmed cases.

According to Johns Hopkins University, Belgium has a known-case mortality rate of 14.9 per cent, France 13.6 per cent and the United States 5.5 per cent.

Meanwhile, the number of people in the US filing for unemployment benefits jumped another 4.4 million last week, taking the total to nearly 27 million.

One state, Michigan, reported an unemployment rate of 22 per cent.

The relentless increase in the jobless has intensified the debate over when to lift restrictions that have helped halt the virus’s rapid spread but placed the economy in a stranglehold.

Some states are pushing forward with plans to reopen their economies, despite not yet meeting federal guidelines about infection rates.

State agencies have scrambled to handle the overwhelming flood of filings as well as a set of federal eligibility rules instituted to deal with the crisis.

With government phones and websites clogged and drop-in centres closed, legal aid lawyers are fielding complaints from people who say they don’t know where else to turn.

About one in six American workers have lost their jobs in the past five weeks, by far the worst string of lay-offs on record. That’s more than the number of people who live in Australia.

Economists have forecast that the unemployment rate for April could go as high as 20 per cent.

Some economists say the nation’s output could shrink by twice the amount that it did during the Great Recession, which ended in 2009.

It comes as debate within the US about states “reopening” their economies is becoming the biggest talking point of the coronavirus pandemic in America.

With unemployment reaching record levels, a number of states plan to start reopening businesses – well ahead of federal guidelines.

Georgia, for instance, is reopening many businesses today, while the government’s leading health agency says the state should not do so until June at the earliest.

Meanwhile, Britain’s economy has been ravaged by the deadly novel coronavirus, which now threatens potentially the worst recession in several centuries, the Bank of England warned on Thursday.

Policymaker Gertjan Vlieghe, who sits on the central bank’s interest rate setting committee, issued the gloomy warning as survey data showed UK business activity shrivelled up this month on the back of COVID-19 lockdowns at home and abroad.

“Based on the early indicators, and based on the experience in other countries that were hit (by the virus) somewhat earlier than the UK, it seems that we are experiencing an economic contraction that is faster and deeper than anything we have seen in the past century, or possibly several centuries,” said economist Vlieghe.

Britain’s nationwide lockdown was imposed on March 23 in a bid to halt the spread of the pandemic, mirroring severe restrictions to daily life introduced elsewhere.

It comees as coronavirus cases in the UK have risen to 138,078 as another 4583 caught the deadly disease.

The latest figures from Public Health England also show that the death toll has risen to 18,738 after 638 more deaths were recorded on Thursday (local time).

A cruise ship linked to hundreds of coronavirus infections and at least 19 deaths in Australia departed on Thursday, leaving behind a criminal investigation and public outrage over the handling of the stricken vessel.

The coronavirus-riddled Ruby Princess cruise ship has been guided out of Port Kembla by tug boats, performing a water salute as it leaves Australian waters five weeks after it arrived in Sydney.

The ship has been responsible for 21 deaths and at least 600 cases of COVID-19 across Australia.

Crew members waved from the Ruby Princess as it left Port Kembla, about 80km south of Sydney and where it was docked for more than two weeks, with a large banner hanging from the stern thanking locals.

It is reportedly bound for Manila in the Philippines.

Police are investigating operator Carnival Australia over the circumstances that led to nearly 2,700 passengers — some showing flu-like symptoms — disembarking in mid-March and going home.

Hundreds were later diagnosed with COVID-19 and at least 19 have died from the disease —

CHINA GIVES MORE FUNDING TO WORLD HEALTH ORGANISATION

China says it will offer a further $A50 million to help fund the World Health Organisation.

The announcement comes after US President Donald Trump halted funding amid concerns the UN agency is too “China-centric”.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said the extra funds were to help WHO contain the virus and support developing countries in improving their public health systems.

“At this critical moment, support for WHO helps to strengthen multilateralism and the UN,” Shuang said.

“Led by Director-General Tedros, the WHO has been playing an important role in co-ordinating the international fight against COVID-19 in an objective, fair and professional manner.”

The new Chinese donation was announced on Twitter by Hua Chunying, a spokeswoman for the country’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. “At this crucial moment, supporting WHO is supporting Multilateralism and Global Solidarity,” she wrote.

That funding follows another donation of $A30 million in March, Ms. Hua said. U.S. donations to the organisation have historically outstripped China’s: Of the $A9 billion that the agency received in 2018 and 2019, the United States contributed about $A1.4 billion and China gave $A135 million.

Australia’s COVID-19 positive cases are on the decline, with fewer than 1700 active and more than 5000 recovered.

With just 12 cases reported on Thursday, the average daily increase in infections has dropped to 0.2 per cent.

While Australia is on track to slowing – and eventually eradicating – the spread of the coronavirus, state borders will not open for at least three to four months.

This means Australians will be state-bound and unable to visit friends and family interstate.

Some elective surgeries have resumed on Thursday, however, which includes IVF, dental and eye procedures as well as joint replacements, endoscopy and colonoscopies.

It comes as the federal government is expected to relax the 40-hour per fortnight work limit for international students enrolled in medical courses in an attempt to boost the number of health and disability workers.

It also comes as the Ruby Princess cruise ship leaves Australia and Prime Minister Scott Morrison warns coronavirus complacency could lead Australia to being exposed to soaring death rates sweeping Europe and the US at the moment.

407,407,https://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&objectid=12327133,Covid 19 coronavirus: New York needed ventilators. So they developed one in a month,New York Times: Pandemic inspired a project to design and make ventilator in weeks.,www.nzherald.co.nz,"The nudge came in an email in early March from an Italian friend alarmed by how fast the deadly coronavirus was spreading in his country.

A shortage of ventilators, he told Scott Cohen and Marcel Botha, was a critical problem in Italy, and he warned that it soon would be in the United States, too. He urged the pair to apply their skills to the ventilator challenge.

Both Cohen, co-founder of a technology centre for researchers and startups, and Botha, chief executive of a product design and development company, were skeptical. A standard ventilator, with thousands of parts requiring a complex global supply chain, was hardly a device that could be manufactured quickly and affordably.

""I was dismissive at first,"" said Botha, whose company is called 10XBeta. ""It looked impossible.""

But they soon found a design for a basic ventilator that could serve as their core technology. Since then, they have orchestrated from New York a far-flung collaboration of scientists, engineers, entrepreneurs, physicians and regulatory experts and accomplished in a month what would normally take a year or more.

The result are machines known as ""bridge"" ventilators, or automatic resuscitators, priced at $3,300. They are mainly meant to help less critically ill patients breathe. If patients become sicker, with lung function more compromised by the disease, they still need to be placed on standard ventilators, which typically cost more than $30,000.

On Friday, the Food and Drug Administration approved the new device, the Spiro Wave, to be used on patients in hospitals, under an expedited process called emergency use authorization.

The project was initially targeted at New York City as a stopgap solution for what only a month ago appeared to be a looming, life-threatening shortage of ventilators in the city.

But the urgency has receded for now. While the city's coronavirus death toll continues to mount, hospital admissions are trending down, and intensive-care units seem to have enough ventilators.

But health experts say a machine like the Spiro Wave should be a valuable tool in the arsenal of treatment. It can, they say, expand access to breathing assistance in other parts of the country as the pandemic spreads and especially to rural communities without major medical centres. And capable, low-cost machines could greatly expand access to treatment in developing countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America.

The New York group has fielded inquiries from across the United States and from companies and governments worldwide. It plans to license its design for free.

The project is one of several pushes in the U.S. and abroad to streamline ventilator design and lower costs. This month, Medtronic got FDA approval to offer in the United States a ventilator that it sells in 35 other countries for an average price of less than $10,000. The company is also making the machine's blueprint freely available to other manufacturers.

The hurry-up engineering feat relied on human networks; two in particular stand out. The original design came from a classroom project at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology a decade ago. Since the coronavirus outbreak, MIT professors and students have worked to upgrade the design in collaboration with outside groups. And several key contributors to the project are MIT alumni.

The other network is the government and business community of New York, where Cohen and Botha are based. The city government took on the role of a risk-taking venture investor, first with a $100,000 research grant and then a nearly $10 million agreement to buy 3,000 of the basic ventilators.

""It's essentially a startup that has made unbelievable progress in a short time,"" said James Patchett, chief executive of New York City's Economic Development Corp., which backed the project.

The New York ventilator effort got underway after widespread warnings of shortages. In mid-March, Mayor Bill de Blasio held a conference call with top staff members. De Blasio recalled that the looming ventilator shortage was ""scary as hell."" New York had no ventilator producers, but he told his staff to do and spend what it took to solve the problem.

The city's economic development chief, Patchett, who was on the call, knew Cohen and his technology centre, New Lab, which is in the Brooklyn Navy Yard. Cohen told him about the ventilator-design project that he was putting together. It sounded promising, and the city made its initial grant.

Later, on March 25, after further development of the MIT design, critical care physicians from city's public hospitals and two private hospitals saw the most recent version of the machine. That evening Patchett called Dr. Mitchell Katz, who leads the Health and Hospitals Corp., which operates the city's public hospitals.

""We should definitely do this,"" Katz recalled telling Patchett.

The project had launched about 10 days earlier, after Cohen, on the recommendation of a scientist friend in San Francisco, got in touch with Alex Slocum, a renowned mechanical engineer at MIT whose class created the design in 2010.

A group of faculty and students — Slocum led hardware design, and Daniela Rus, a professor and robotics expert, led software development — worked to upgrade the design to help coronavirus patients. The device would have to be able to push air into badly impaired lungs at several times the force used to resuscitate a normal lung.

""This was going to take a serious machine,"" Slocum recalled.

The New York group began closely collaborating with the MIT team. Dr. Albert Kwon, an MIT graduate and a medical adviser on the project who is an anesthesiologist at the Westchester Medical Centre, and Botha, also an MIT alumnus, and others from New York made several trips to Boston for joint work and testing.

The MIT academics' goal has been mainly to develop designs and share information on a website. But the mission for the New York group was to make the low-cost ventilators quickly. The hub of that effort is a former perfume factory in Long Island City, Queens, that is now home to a high-tech manufacturer, Boyce Technologies.

The temperature of everyone who enters the brick building is taken, a precaution against infection. The 100,000-square-foot facility combines engineering and production with robots, a clean room and circuitry and software design departments.

Manufacturing, engineering and medical experts have worked side by side for three weeks. Dozens of versions of the machine have been carted off to the dumpster, as upgrades and improvements were made. In recent days, MIT engineers traveled to Queens to help with last-minute software tweaks.

""There's a lot you can't see in a model,"" said Charles Boyce, founder and chief executive of Boyce Technologies. ""And if you can't manufacture something at scale, it doesn't matter. It's not going to have an impact.""

Producing thousands of machines means lining up sometimes scarce supplies. One of those parts was an air-pressure sensor to ensure that a patient's lungs were not overinflated, which could cause damage. Cohen knew that Honeywell was a leading producer of the sensor, and he tapped his network of personal contacts to secure it in volume.

Late one night, Cohen called Kathryn Wylde, chief executive of the Partnership for New York City, a business group of the city's top executives. Kevin Burke, a former chief executive of New York-based Con Edison, is a Honeywell board member. Introductions were made, and after a series of calls to Honeywell executives in America and Asia, a supply of the sensors was secured.

The New York ventilator project was intended to address a seemingly urgent need before large-scale initiatives — such as a Ford-General Electric partnership — began to produce ventilators.

While New York's crisis has eased, Katz cautioned that pandemic viruses are unpredictable and mutate. A later variant, or second wave, in the fall could be less lethal or more, as was the case with the second wave of the 1918 flu pandemic.

""This is still a useful option to have, even if there is not the urgency there was,"" he said.

The low-cost ventilator, de Blasio said, is an ""invaluable tool"" and part of the stockpile of medical equipment and supplies the city needs as ""insurance against a Phase 2"" of the pandemic.

""We have to get through this first,"" he said. ""But for the future, we have to have an ongoing self-sufficiency effort in New York. What we've gone through should be a never-again moment.""

Prof Chris Whitty, England's chief medical officer, yesterday suggested the UK would have to prepare for some measures to remain in place even after the lockdown begins to lift.

And Michael Gove this weekend warned pubs, restaurants and bars could be among the last to re-open, with some premises set to stay shut until the autumn or winter.

Boris Johnson's spokesman did not deny claims we could have to continue social distancing until 2021 - raising the bleak prospect of pubs shuttered beyond the festive season.

He stressed the government must do ""everything we can"" to keep the infection rate down.

The PM's spokesman today stressed he was not making a prediction as it is too early to discuss lifting the lockdown - and said he would not ""pre-empt"" scientific advice.

He refused to deny any remarks made by Chris Whitty, who led yesterday's media briefing at Downing Street.

The PM's official spokesman said: ""The key to this is not having a second peak.

""Having a second peak would be bad not only on health grounds, but also bad for business and the economy.

""We have to do everything we can to keep R below one and prevent that second peak.

""In terms of the steps we take in the coming weeks and months will be guided by the scientific advice. It’s not sensible for me to pre-empt that.""

The No10 spokesman added the most important factor is that ""R, the rate of transmission, needs to be below one.

""We cannot allow the R to go above one for any extended period at any point.""

He went on: ""I think the Chief Medical Officer set out in a significant amount of detail the issues which himself and his colleagues and then ministers will have to look at as we go forward."""
409,409,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/truck-maker-volvo-first-quarter-053631696.html,"Sweden's Volvo hit by cancelled orders as pandemic creates ""new normal""","Sweden's AB Volvo on Thursday warned of stalling truck orders and a challenging adjustment to a ""new normal"" of feebler demand after reporting a smaller-than-expected fall in quarterly operating earnings helped by service sales.  The rival to Germany's Daimler and Volkswagen subsidiary",finance.yahoo.com,"STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Sweden's AB Volvo on Thursday warned of stalling truck orders and a challenging adjustment to a ""new normal"" of feebler demand after reporting a smaller-than-expected fall in quarterly operating earnings helped by service sales.

The rival to Germany's Daimler and Volkswagen subsidiary Traton said its net order intake had turned negative since the end of March as customers rushed to cancel planned truck purchases due to the coronavirus pandemic.

The Gothenburg-based manufacturer last suffered a demand downturn on a similar scale during the 2008 global financial crisis when cancellations outpaced new orders for a full quarter. Volvo shares fell 6.65% by 0850 GMT.

Already facing a cyclical slowdown before the outbreak brought markets and production to a halt in Europe and North America last month, the slump is set to test Volvo which in the past has struggled to handle violent swings in demand.

""In the coming quarters, it will be challenging to reduce costs with the same speed and magnitude as revenues are decreasing,"" CEO Martin Lundstedt said in a statement, adding he expected demand for services to suffer too.

Adjusted operating profit at the maker of trucks, construction equipment, buses and engines fell to 7.1 billion Swedish crowns ($704 million) from 12.7 billion but topped the 6 billion expected by analysts, Refinitiv Eikon estimates showed.

Volvo last month shelved plans for an extra shareholder payout though it said on Thursday it still intended to pay its ordinary dividend for 2019.

One of Sweden's biggest private sector employers with a global workforce of 100,000, the company said it aimed to ""cautiously restart"" manufacturing in Europe, North America and Brazil at low levels at the end of April and beginning of May.

""Everyone is struggling with what the ramp-up and new normal will look like,"" Lundstedt said in a conference call.

""Our current estimate is that the gradual return will be slow and activities in the Volvo group need to be adjusted.""

While factories may be stirring back to life, uncertainty lingers as to how much demand will be there to meet the output.

Order intake of its trucks under brands such as Mack and Renault as well as its own name fell 16% in the first quarter but Volvo warned the decline had been 75% in March versus February and net negative since then.

Volvo, which in January saw the market falling by just under 15% in Europe and by nearly 30% in North America this year, said it was now not meaningful to try to forecast.

""It was rather expected that they wouldn't give forecasts ... since uncertainty is so big and visibility almost none,"" Handelsbanken Capital Markets analyst Hampus Engellau said.($1 = 10.0825 Swedish crowns)"

The new rules make 1,200 megahertz of spectrum available for unlicensed use -- effectively increasing the amount of spectrum available for Wi-Fi by nearly a factor of five.

""These new rules will usher in Wi-Fi 6, the next generation of Wi-Fi, and play a major role in the growth of the Internet of Things,"" the FCC said in a release. ""In making broad swaths of the 6 GHz spectrum available for unlicensed use, the FCC envisions new innovative technologies and services that will deliver new devices and applications to American consumers and advance the Commission's goal of making broadband connectivity available to all Americans, especially those in rural and underserved areas.""

Under the new rules, unlicensed devices have to share the spectrum with licensed services already on the spectrum band. When the FCC first floated the idea of opening up the 6 GHz band in 2018, it was met with pushback from licensed users. For instance, AT&T noted that it owns more than 8,000 licenses on the spectrum band, supporting backhaul for its mobile networks, as well as telecommunications links for its landline assets. Additionally, AT&T highlighted that a portion of the 6 GHz spectrum band supports critical infrastructure like public safety licensees and utility grids.

The new rules authorize two different types of unlicensed operations: First, it allows indoor low-power operations over the full 1,200-megahertz available. Additionally, it allows outdoor devices to operate at standard power in 850-megahertz of the band. An automated frequency coordination system will prevent standard-power access points from operating where they could cause interference to incumbent services.

Meanwhile, the FCC is seeking further comment on a proposal to let very low-power devices operate across the 6 GHz band to support high data rate applications, such as high-performance, wearable, AR and VR devices.

Thursday's vote was hailed by industry players like the Wi-Fi Alliance, which said the decision ""will transform wireless connectivity for decades to come."" Earlier this year, Wi-Fi Alliance announced the expansion of its Wi-Fi 6 certification program to include Wi-Fi 6E, ensuring interoperability in devices capable of 6 GHz operation.

On Twitter, Google's public policy office responded to the vote, saying, ""Opening the 6GHz band will help increase wireless innovation and enable Americans to better connect to remote work, distance learning, telehealth and more.""

Comcast executive Tony Werner said in a statement that the move is ""a significant step on the path to deploying next generation, gigabit Wi‑Fi services to complement our world‑class gigabit broadband networks.""

The public advocacy group Public Knowledge also applauded the vote. Bertram Lee, policy counsel for the group, said in a statement that ""Consumers will potentially see concrete benefits from these new rules as early as this holiday season, when new equipment capable of using the entire 6 GHz band enables home devices to run at gigabit speeds.""

Let's look at 1918.,States are starting to reopen as cases of coronavirus plateau. Evidence from the 1918 flu pandemic suggests that is a mistake.,www.businessinsider.com,"Hello, everyone!

SUMMARY: What happens if we reopen too early? We might have to close down again and stay under lockdown for twice as long. How coronavirus spreads in restaurants. More bad news for Trump's miracle drug. The Senate finds no evidence that the Russia investigation was a deep-state conspiracy. When it comes to disaster response, the more things change, the more politics stays the same.

What happens if we reopen too early? Let's look at 1918 ...

As debates rage about whether we should prioritize health or the economy — and about when and how to reopen — we should keep this in mind.

Studies of the ""Great Influenza"" of 1918 concluded that cities that adopted ""non-pharmaceutical intervention"" measures earlier and kept them in place for longer did better, both health-wise and economically. Specifically, they had fewer deaths and their economies recovered faster.

In other words, in 1918 it wasn't health or the economy. It was health and the economy.

Different cities approached the 1918 epidemic differently, as a 2007 study from Howard Markel, Harvey Lipman, and J. Alexander Navarro shows. The varying experiences include a warning about what could happen if we reopen too early.

St. Louis, Denver, and San Francisco, for example, adopted ""distancing"" measures early, which helped mitigate the initial epidemic wave. All three cities, however, then relaxed their measures early … and then saw second waves. In St. Louis and Denver, these second waves were worse than the first. As the second waves took hold, the cities reimplemented distancing measures, but it was too late.

Deaths attributed to the flu epidemic in St. Louis in 1918-19. Markel, Lipman, and Navarro, 2007.

Deaths attributed to the flu in Denver in 1918-19. Markel, Lipman, and Navarro, 2007.

The same thing happened in San Francisco, as Insider's Katie Canales shows in a vivid photo essay.

In 1918 — just as in 2020 — San Francisco was one of the first cities to shut down, and it got the epidemic under control. However, five weeks later, with cases declining, the city declared victory too early and reopened too fast. (Literally. As Katie reports, ""a whistle blew and people poured out into the streets in celebration, tossing their masks in the process."")

A few weeks later, cases started climbing again. San Francisco tried to shut down again, but many frustrated citizens resisted the orders. The second wave continued for months, as this chart from National Geographic shows.

Meanwhile, other cities took a different approach, keeping their initial restrictions in place for longer. New York City issued basic isolation and quarantine rules earlier than other cities and then kept them in place until its death rate returned to a very low rate. The city saw only one major wave of infections, and its total death rate was at the lower end of the US range.

Importantly, despite having its initial rules in place for longer, New York's restrictions were only in place for about half the total time as those in St. Louis and Denver. The rush to reopen in those cities, in other words, led to second shutdowns that lasted about as long as the first.

Another lesson from the 1918 experience is that restrictions are not ""all or nothing."" There are different measures and approaches, of varying degrees of severity. So as some states begin to roll back some restrictions, we should probably stop acting as though the decision is binary. —HB

While we're thinking about when and how to reopen, here's a fascinating study of how coronavirus spread in a restaurant. It holds both good and bad news for restaurant reopenings.

As Insider's Bill Bostock reports, a letter from researchers in China that was published by the CDC traced an infection that spread one afternoon in late January among three families sitting near each other in a large restaurant in Guangzhou.

During this meal, a woman who had just arrived from Wuhan and was still asymptomatic apparently spread the virus to nine other diners nearby. The woman developed symptoms later that day. The others did within the next week to 10 days.

It's frightening — and it's bad news for restaurants — to realize that one asymptomatic person can spread the virus to nine other people eating nearby. But the study also contained additional insights. Everyone who got infected in the restaurant was in the same airflow of an air-conditioner. Other diners nearby, despite being just as close to the infected person, did not get sick. The professor and journalist Zeynep Tufekci theorizes that this supports the idea that the coronavirus spreads via ""micro-droplets"" but does not fully ""aerosolize.""

Regardless, this study should sober up anyone hoping to eat out or open their restaurant anytime soon. Yes, wearing masks would probably help. But it's hard to eat while wearing a mask. —HB

Hydroxychloroquine isn't a miracle drug. Here's what that mistaken hope cost us.

Hope, like toilet paper, is in short supply these days. So it's not surprising that we cling to any seeming bit of good news. But there's a cost to misplaced hope, and we're seeing it with the deflated enthusiasm for the drug hydroxychloroquine.

Remember hydroxychloroquine? Just two weeks ago, President Donald Trump and a choir of others were touting it as a ""game changer"" for COVID-19, pointing to claims by a French doctor — let's be blunt, an eccentric, Trumpish French doctor — that he had cured 100% of his COVID patients with it.

Fox News went gaga over this apparent wonder drug. So did Dr. Oz. And doctors began prescribing it. The FDA gave emergency approval to use it on American COVID-19 patients. And tests of it alone, and in conjunction with the antibiotic azithromycin, were started.

Alas, so far, no good news.

On Tuesday, the National Institutes for Health recommended against using hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 patients outside clinical trials, citing a heart risk. The same day, a retrospective study of 368 veterans found higher death rates in patients treated with hydroxychloroquine and no reduction in the risk of ending up on a ventilator. This followed a French study also showing no benefit to using the drug for COVID-19. And Trump, Dr. Oz, and Fox have all finally stopped hyping it.

It's still possible that hydroxychloroquine might help against COVID-19. There haven't been any randomized controlled trials disproving its effectiveness. But there also hasn't been any clear evidence that it works.

So what's the harm in all the hype about it? As Trump said, ""What do you have to lose?""

The optimism fanned by Fox News and Trump had costs. It caused a shortage of the drug for the lupus and arthritis patients who need it. Hydroxychloroquine overdoses doubled over the same period last year. An Arizona man died when he self-medicated by taking a related chemical used to clean fish tanks.

The hydroxychloroquine hype also distorted medical care around the country for a few critical weeks. The president threw the weight of the federal government — and an FDA emergency action — into a drug that may not help at all, much less be a miracle.

It's not that we shouldn't be testing hydroxychloroquine — of course we should! — but the presidential and media hype caused an over-investment of time and mental energy, and took effort and intellect away from testing other therapies.

The hydroxychloroquine-hype machine also spent down one of most precious commodities we have: public trust. Every miracle cure that raises — then dashes — hope increases skepticism, and makes it less likely that Americans will trust the doctors and public health authorities later, when we're asked to get a vaccine or take a prophylactic medicine.

The latest casualty of the president's brief hydroxychloroquine obsession appears to be Dr. Rick Bright, the director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, who says he was ousted after resisting pressure to hype and fund it. The administration disputes this characterization. —DP

While we're paying attention to the pandemic ...

The Republican-led Senate Intelligence Community released a unanimous report concluding that the intelligence community's investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 election was analytically sound, justified by the evidence, and conducted professionally.

""The committee found no reason to dispute the intelligence community's conclusions,"" chair Sen. Richard Burr, a Republican from North Carolina, said.

During the Mueller investigation and impeachment, Trump said the investigations were corrupted by ""deep state"" interference, malevolent manipulation by President Barack Obama, and overreliance on the Steele dossier. The Senate committee found none of that. —DP

The more things change, the more politics stays the same

""Even now, nearly two months after disaster first struck, the federal response remains inadequate and disorganized. Americans are rightly angry about this failure of government.""

Marking the 10th anniversary of the Deepwater Horizon oil well disaster in the Gulf of Mexico, John Dickerson of ""60 Minutes"" excavated some of the Republican (and Democratic) responses to the Obama administration's handling of it. They sound surprisingly familiar.

What did now-Vice President Mike Pence say back then, for example?

""The American people want answers ... The American people know this was a slow response.""

But Brian Kemp, governor of the southern state of Georgia, and Florida's Ron DeSantis, both Republicans like Trump, have announced more aggressive easing of restrictions. Kemp said that from Friday he is allowing gyms, bowling alleys, tattoo parlors, barbershops, nail salons and other small firms to reopen.

At his daily briefing, Trump told reporters ""it's too soon"" for those businesses to resume operations, but Kemp separately said he is not just ""throwing the keys back"" for them to operate without guidelines.

""I told the governor of Georgia, Brian Kemp, that I disagree strongly with his decision to open certain facilities which are in violation of the Phase One guidelines"" for reopening issued last week.

There must be 14 days of declining infection numbers before a reopening, the government said.

""I respect him and I will let him make his decision. Would I do that? No. I'd keep them (closed) a little bit longer. I want to protect people's lives,"" Trump said.

At the same press conference, the country's top infectious disease expert, Anthony Fauci, said that if he were advising Kemp, ""I would tell him that he should be careful. And I would advise him not to just turn the switch on and go.""

Just before that press conference, and after he had spoken with Trump, Kemp told Fox 5 Atlanta that his decision was based upon data and that ""trends are going in the right direction.""

He said it will be a ""measured approach"" and businesses resuming trade will have to follow ""strict guidelines.""

""I think one of the things that's gotten out of control on the national level is people think we're throwing the keys back to these businesses and it's going to be business as usual, and it's not,"" Kemp told Fox 5 Atlanta.

Under his plan, restaurants will be able to resume dine-in service from Monday."

Below is a statement jointly produced by the two organisations:

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans.

In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).

The most recently discovered coronavirus causes the COVID-19 disease.

Anyone anywhere can be infected by the virus.

It infects people through coughing and sneezing, touching an infected person’s hands or face or touching infected objects an infected person has touched. It is like all the other viruses that cause common cold and is common in winter.

Main symptoms of Covid-19 are cough, sore throat, fever shortness of breath.

In people with an immunocompromised immune system such as children, elderly, those with heart diseases they might develop respiratory tract infections such as pneumonia or bronchitis.

There are ways one can protect themselves from catching the virus. Prevention methods include: washing hands with soap and running water or using a hand rub always.

Avoid touching the eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands. One must also remember to sanitize door handles at one’s house, office or shop.

Avoid close contact with infected people. Those infected should also cover their nose, mouth when coughing.

According to WHO, washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.

You need to take note of social distancing…

When someone coughs or sneezes he or she sprays small liquid droplets from his or her nose or mouth which may contain virus.

If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.

However, if infected one needs plenty of rest, lots of fluids and manage the symptoms such as sore throat and fever. If there is a pneumonia or bronchitis one should also receive appropriate treatment for that respiratory tract infection.

Currently there outbreak is causing havoc across the globe and in Zimbabwe 28 cases have been confirmed.

Because this is a communicable virus it spreads rapidly therefore always protect yourself and your community.

Prevention is always better than cure.

KNOXVILLE, Tenn. — You may have heard health experts speak of the COVID-19 pandemic as something unprecedented since the ""Spanish flu"" of 1918. But how much can our technology-dominated society relate to what people endured more than a century ago?

A lot. A whole lot. In fact, it's remarkable how similar the situation was in 1918 when looking through the archives of East Tennessee newspapers.

The world was at war in the summer of 1918 when the ""Spanish flu"" started spreading across Europe. Local headlines in August noted the virus was hurting Germany's military efforts.

As American troops came home through a handful of seaports, they caught the flu and brought it home to every corner of the country. The assistant secretary of the Navy fell ill on a ship and recovered. His name was Franklin D. Roosevelt, the future president of the United States.

The flu showed up in Nashville and Johnson City in early-September. However, it was downplayed as mostly mild with no need for panic or hysteria.

On October 5, 1918, the City of Knoxville had 200 confirmed cases of Spanish flu, not counting the students at the University of Tennessee or troops at an Army hospital set up at Chilhowee Park.

People were told to take steps to ward off influenza by not congregating, covering your mouth and nostrils with a handkerchief or mask, and ""keep your mouth shut and your hands clean."" There were other bits of advice that seem out of place today, such as taking laxatives and gargling with antiseptic.

The outbreak wasn't just in bigger cities. The virus rocked mining communities such as Oakdale and Coalfield. Newport and Greenback were hit hard by the flu.

As businesses were hurting, some people saw the opportunity to capitalize on the situation. There was a lemon shortage as it was thought the citrus aided flu-stricken people. Some lemon speculators bought and hoarded the fruit to boost the price.

A shoe store on Gay Street advertised drafty environments and slippers might give you the flu. ""Get shoes today and be ready. Get 'em at Spence Shoe Co.""

By October 24, Knoxville reported 6,932 cases and 91 deaths. The situation was said to be improving because only 226 new cases and nine deaths were reported that day.

On Friday, Nov. 1, 1918, the city of Knoxville announced the flu ban would end on Sunday. Churches would be allowed to reopen. At that point, there were 131 deaths and 8,984 cases in Knoxville since the epidemic began.

There was spike in cases when Knoxville resumed business as usual. The headline on Nov. 23, 1918 in The Journal and Tribute read, ""Flu Epidemic Takes New Hold."" The total cases since the outbreak climbed to 10,076 with 175 deaths. Nonetheless, Knoxville was not hit as severely as other parts of the state and nation.

As the population celebrated the end of what was then the deadliest war in the history of the world, the Spanish flu virus had killed an estimated 20 to 40 million people worldwide. That's two to four time the number of people killed in the First World War. Headlines noted, ""Spanish Flu Worse Than Hun Bullets."" The virus killed more than half a million Americans."

The petition, filed by social activist Harnam Singh through advocate Mahmood Pracha, is expected to come up for hearing in the High Court on Friday.

The plea sought directions to authorities concerned to ""provide protective equipment to the sanitation workers"" who have been working ""tirelessly and selflessly"" during the COVID-19 pandemic, which it said has put the lives of billions of people across the world at risk.

It said that the petitioner had earlier approached the Supreme Court for securing the safety of the ""vulnerable and highly exposed"" sanitation workers, and the Supreme Court had disposed of the petition while recording the categorical submission that adequate safety equipment was being provided to them as per mandatory WHO guidelines.

""Even though the order implies that the safety of all sanitation workers has been ensured by strict compliance with guidelines for disbursement of protective equipment to them, the petitioner has come across information from several sources, including news articles, of the completely hapless and offensive extent to which sanitation workers have been left to fend for themselves against COVID-19 while performing their essential public function which is in itself crucial for restricting the spread of the pandemic,"" the plea said.

It said that the sanitation workers largely belong to a lower economic category and that these workers are unlikely to have the means and opportunity to approach this court, and therefore the petitioner is moving the present petition in the public interest.

The petitioner, in the plea, said that he has written letters to authorities over the issue but so far no adequate measures has been taken in the matter, and therefore he is moving the petition due to the urgent and immediate nature of the issue.

It said that unlike doctors, who work in a controlled and sanitized environment, sanitation workers function in unhygienic conditions and run a higher risk of getting infected with the virus. (ANI)"
420,420,http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/credit-suisse-traders-still-carry-the-bank/45711964,Credit Suisse Traders Still Carry the Bank,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- For a bank that has tried so hard to shed its “Wall Street” image back home, Switzerland’s Credit Suisse Group AG is still ...",www.swissinfo.ch,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- For a bank that has tried so hard to shed its “Wall Street” image back home, Switzerland’s Credit Suisse Group AG is still hugely reliant on its trading arm. Its first set of earnings since the Covid-19 lockdown is a reminder of just how volatile the securities and lending business can be.

Chief Executive Officer Thomas Gottstein, in the job for just two months, has had a baptism of fire, he told Bloomberg Television on Thursday. As entire continents shut their economies in the first quarter of 2020 and markets gyrated wildly, the Swiss giant suffered its biggest hit from loan provisions and markdowns in more than a decade. They totaled more than $1 billion. Trading revenue was higher as institutional and wealthy clients bought and sold more securities, helping to cushion the blow, but Gottstein can’t count on that being repeated.

In the equities and fixed-income units, trading revenue jumped by 25% to $2.2 billion, beating analyst expectations. That’s even after the firm lost $182 million, mainly on a single-name counterparty. While private clients are now keeping almost one-third of their assets in cash, transaction revenue soared 31% in the period, when compared to the same quarter last year. It’s hard to imagine that this is sustainable. Some American peers have warned on the outlook; Gottstein told Bloomberg TV that his bank’s trading volumes were still decent but have fallen a little.

Showing how risky trading has become, the firm’s value-at-risk — its assessment of the most it could lose on one day — jumped to $103 million at the end of the quarter from an average of $27 million at the end of 2019.

Meantime, the credit outlook is — to put it mildly — uncertain. Credit Suisse set aside 376 million Swiss francs ($386 million) to cover potential losses in its loan book. Unlike its European peers, the bank reports under U.S. GAAP accounting standards, and the level of provisioning is in line with Wall Street’s firms, it said. Its assumption of a 20% second-quarter contraction in U.S. gross domestic product — and a recession in Europe, the U.S. and Switzerland this year, with a 2% to 3% recovery in global GDP in 2021 — is probably as good a guess as any.

And yet this isn’t just about the broader market. Credit Suisse’s own book warrants a closer look too. Though the firm has cut back its exposure to the oil and gas industry to $7.7 billion, of which just over a third is junk-rated debt, its quarterly credit losses stemmed mostly from the oil industry. And that was before this week’s wild dip below zero for WTI prices.

Even more painful were the unrealized mark-to-market losses of 284 million Swiss francs in leveraged finance and 160 million Swiss francs in Asia-Pacific lending. Asked why a bank that has pivoted to wealth management is still so ensconced in higher yielding but riskier lending, Gottstein was categorical: At $7.3 billion, he said, the bank’s leveraged finance exposure is 85% lower than at its peak, but the business remains critical to the firm’s profitability. Private equity continues to dominate investment banking activity and clients are now starting discussions about taking businesses private, he added.

And in a reminder of how lending to wealthy clients can backfire, the company’s biggest loss in Asia was on Luckin Coffee Inc., which collapsed amid an accounting scandal. Credit Suisse was one of the biggest creditors on defaulted loans to Luckin’s founder.

All told, however, it wasn’t such a bad quarter for the Swiss bank. It posted 1.3 billion Swiss francs in net profit, in part thanks to a negative tax rate, and it’s sticking with a target for a return on tangible equity of 10% — while acknowledging that meeting the goal will be difficult.

Like everybody else, the fortunes of Credit Suisse will depend on how quickly and effectively the world’s economies emerge from the Covid-19 lockdowns. “Does it take much imagination if the current environment persists that we see those profits disappear and Credit Suisse turn loss-making,” asked one analyst on Thursday’s conference call. Gottstein replied that he has no trouble sleeping but a second wave of coronavirus infections would be the worst scenario. Investors will have to wait a bit longer for any kind of certainty.

The company said the plan was “health before production numbers” as the assembly line started up after a five-week closure under new health rules agreed with worker representatives that include wearing face protection where a 1.5 meter (six-foot) distance can’t always be observed. Other measures include regular cleanings. Distancing is required in washrooms, changing rooms and lunchrooms.

At restart the plan was to make 50 cars per day, about a third of previous output.

Volkswagen worker Heiko Gruner told the dpa news agency he was grateful to be back. “For the past weeks I missed the purpose and the usual structure of the day,” said the 49-year-old.

The plant makes the ID.3 electric compact, which is key to Volkswagen’s plan to make battery only cars a mass-market product. Currently, electrics remain a niche product with sales in single digits and many of the offerings are in the luxury category. Volkswagen aims to sell the car for prices starting below 30,000 euros ($32,400).

Manufacturing plants in several European countries have resumed work in recent days as some governments look to ease some of the lockdown measures that have dealt a blow to the economy."

Our mission is to provide a news and information service which helps the UK journalism.,www.pressgazette.co.uk,"The Electoral Commission has called for “new laws or standards of conduct” to stop political parties using “misleading” campaign techniques such as designing election leaflets to mimic local newspapers.

Press Gazette called for an end to the practice during December’s general election after a number of egregious examples were shared by regional journalists around the UK.

The Liberal Democrats published a leaflet with a typical newspaper front-page layout and the masthead “Mid-Hampshire Gazette”, which journalists feared could be mistaken for Newsquest’s Basingstoke Gazette.

Other Lib Dem constituencies and some from the Conservatives and Labour created similar pamphlets.

Press Gazette said: “The attempt to deceive voters into believing they are reading a newspaper, however blatant, imperils the professional output of journalists at a time when our industry is under threat.

“Local newspapers have long been praised as pillars of the communities they serve, so it is small wonder politicians are keen for some of this to rub off on them, but it is far better they engage with the press than try to copy it.”

In its report on the December election published this week, the Electoral Commission shared concerns about “misleading campaign techniques” such as these, saying they can undermine public trust.

It also pointed to social media pages without clear branding as to who was responsible for them, and parties editing video clips to present their opponents in a negative light.

The Conservative Party temporarily rebranded its press office’s Twitter account to appear as a fact-checking service during one of the televised leader debates in a move the was heavily criticised.

It also released doctored video of Labour’s Keir Starmer appearing to show him struggling to answer a question on Good Morning Britain.

The Electoral Commission said: “We have signalled our concern about these issues before. If voters lose trust and confidence in political campaigning, democracy as a whole will suffer.

“Campaigners, candidates and parties themselves need to take greater responsibility for the presentation and content of campaigns they run and the impact of their activities on public confidence in elections.”

The body added that the country “cannot afford to miss the window of opportunity between now and the next scheduled general election”.

“There needs to be real change to protect trust and confidence in campaigns at future elections and the integrity of our democracy,” it went on.

“It will take governments, parties, campaigners, social media companies and regulators to work together to agree new laws or standards of conduct. We will support this work.”

Society of Editors executive director Ian Murray said the report showed the “hypocrisy of some in the political class who complain about fake news and a perceived lack of trust in the media, and then undermine trust themselves”."

A New Zealand nurse who treated British Prime Minister Boris Johnson while he was in hospital with COVID-19 said she saw the world leader as “just another patient” and that she thought he was joking when he singled her out for praise.

Jenny McGee, who has worked for the UK National Health Service (NHS) since 2010, told a New Zealand television station that she was unfazed by the task of caring for Johnson, who received the same care as any other patient and “absolutely needed to be there.”

“There was a lot of media interest about him being in hospital and, to be honest, that was the toughest,” McGee told TVNZ in an interview, which aired yesterday, her first public remarks since the episode.

“As a unit, he was just another patient we were trying to do our best for, so it was business as usual. It was just another day at the office,” McGee added.

Johnson, 55, was taken to Guys and St Thomas’ hospital on April 5 after his symptoms for COVID-19 worsened and he was moved into intensive care the following day, remaining there until April 9.

On being discharged on April 12, Johnson said in a video message: “The NHS saved my life, no question.”

He named and thanked the nurses who had cared for him, including “Jenny from New Zealand.”

When Johnson sent that public message, McGee said in the interview, she was getting ready for her nightshift and a friend texted her the update.

“My first reaction was that it was a joke,” she said.

As McGee carried out intensive care duties, she and said she and the prime minister “spent a lot of time together and we talked away about NZ,” particularly about her home city of Invercargill, which she said he took an interest in.

After shifts caring for the British leader, she said she would get in her car and “hear things about Boris Johnson on the news that was very surreal because I thought: ‘wow, I’ve been looking after him.’”

“But I really wasn’t fazed by looking after Boris Johnson,” she added.

Johnson was not the only national leader to congratulate McGee, who acknowledged she took longer than planned to respond to a message from New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern.

“It’s very surreal to have a message from Jacinda. She’s a hero of mine,” McGee said.

Once the nurse did respond to the New Zealand leader, the two shared “a little bit of banter which again was surreal, [and] a couple of emojis,” she said."
427,427,https://www.thisisanfield.com/2020/04/the-gini-wijnaldum-type-how-liverpools-no-5-is-helping-redefine-the-midfield-role/,The Gini type: How Wijnaldum is redefining the midfield role,"Latest Liverpool FC news, analysis and transfer rumours from This Is Anfield",www.thisisanfield.com,"Throughout his four years at Liverpool so far, Gini Wijnaldum‘s exact role has been difficult to place, but the Dutchman offers a rare quality that makes him invaluable.

Reinvention has made Liverpool revolutionaries. The positions seem like misnomers for their flagship players. Right-back? Trent Alexander-Arnold is both a playmaker and a one-man right flank. Centre-forward? Roberto Firmino is more false nine, often only Liverpool’s third-most advanced player and doubling up as a tireless harrier in midfield. Winger? Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salah are both inverted and narrow, operating inside the opponents’ full-backs, rather than outside, focused more on scoring than crossing.

Few suggest Gini Wijnaldum’s impact is as radical. Sometimes Liverpool’s midfield are defined as much by what they don’t do—score, or at least, score regularly—as what they do, which is to knit the team together and work relentlessly. In his own way, though, Liverpool’s smiling Dutchman is a very modern player. Few talk about the Wijnaldum type among midfielders. Perhaps they should.

Once again, it is perhaps easiest to outline what he isn’t as opposed to what he is. Rewind 11 years to what, despite the prowess of Jurgen Klopp’s team, still feels the best trio of central midfielders Liverpool have had in the Premier League era and the comparisons may not seem to flatter Wijnaldum.

He is not the tackler Javier Mascherano was. He does not have Xabi Alonso’s long passing range (or, as he only attempts one long pass a game on average, if he does he keeps it camouflaged). He lacks Steven Gerrard’s potency: he may have been the scourge of Barcelona last season but Wijnaldum only has five goals in all competitions this season. Gerrard got 24 in 2008/09.

The Dutchman is not exactly in contention for the Golden Boot. But there is one leaderboard where he will figure on an annual basis. Among those remotely resembling regulars in the Premier League, he stands fourth for pass completion: his 90.9 percent success rate puts him behind only the Man City trio of Nicolas Otamendi, Rodri and Ilkay Gundogan. That is fractionally down on last season, where he completed 91.1 percent of his passes, but it amounts to a remarkable level of consistency. It can get even higher in major matches, indicating the temperament of a player cool enough to prosper under pressure.

Wijnaldum is a different type of pass-master; not delivering the raking diagonal balls Gerrard would place into space for Michael Owen to run into, the elegant incision of Alonso or the ambitious, defence-splitting service Kevin De Bruyne gives the City attackers. Many of Wijnaldum’s passes are less spectacular and shorter, but his accuracy makes him one of the smoothest cogs in the wheel.

He is not the creator; not directly, anyway. The Comparisonator statistical website shows only seven of his league passes this season have even led to a shot; none have brought an assist. Fifty central midfielders average more passes that lead to a shot per 90 minutes (De Bruyne, inevitably, is top).

But Wijnaldum has 125 successful passes into the final third—out of 135—offering unusual levels of ball retention in the part of the pitch where it is hardest to keep it. It is something that distinguishes the midfielders who figure highly in the pass completion charts; it is easier to distort defenders’ statistics with safe balls in their own half.

Look at those midfielders over several seasons and the same names crop up near the top of the pass completion statistics. They can seem a disparate bunch, divided by more than unites them, but that accuracy makes them the Wijnaldum type: Harry Winks and Ross Barkley, Mateo Kovacic and Gundogan, Juan Mata and Granit Xhaka. More recent arrivals like Rodri and Jorginho have joined the band. Mousa Dembele was their unofficial chairman before his departure.

They are very modern figures: the goalscoring midfielders of earlier eras, the Gerrard and Frank Lampard type, feel an endangered species, replaced by the passers who are not so much playmakers as playkeepers.

Some of the Wijnaldum type feel frustrating figures. Most seem to score too few goals and several do not feel as if they get enough assists either. Some provoke debate as to what, actually, they are. Dembele was a case in point, an enigma until Mauricio Pochettino appreciated his unique skillset and turned him into a talisman. Kovacic ranked as a disappointment last season; this year, he is arguably Chelsea’s player of the season. But Barkley and Xhaka feel mysteries wrapped inside a riddle. Players like Winks and Gundogan do not feel destructive enough to play the holding role or productive enough to operate further forward but are their respective sides’ midfield metronomes.

There are common denominators. It is no coincidence they are found near the top of the table. They have the technical skills to gravitate to elite clubs; Wijnaldum allies it with the physical power to play Jurgen Klopp’s running game. The difficulty is finding complementary players, the ones who can deliver the goals or assists or, in some cases, tackles, they don’t.

It is about a system, it is about team-building. It is there that Klopp and Liverpool have succeeded with Wijnaldum.

It is also about their reinvention of him. He is more potent for the Netherlands, just as he was for Newcastle, when he operated further forward and when, though a season ended in relegation and he was far more effective at home, his return of 11 goals and five assists was Gerrard-esque.

No more. His is a more self-sacrificial role for Liverpool. But if the Wijnaldum who first arrived in England drew comparisons with the past, now he feels an altogether newer type of player."

Governors of the 36 States of the federation on Wednesday ""unanimously"" agreed to the implementation of an inter-State lockdown in the country over the next two weeks to mitigate the spread of the pandemic COVID-19 virus from State to State.

The governors, operating under the aegis of the Nigeria Governors' Forum (NGF), reached the agreement after receiving briefing from the Governors of Lagos, Bauchi, Oyo and Ogun States who shared their experiences and lessons from the fight against COVID-19.

A communiqe issued by the NGF chairman and governor of Ekiti State, Kayode Fayemi, at the end of the sixth COVID-19 teleconference meeting said only essential services would be permitted.

State governors called for the decentralization of the COVID-19 response as the best chance of nipping the spread of the virus in communities with over 25 States now affected by the spread of the virus and increasing evidence of community transmission.

Members of the NGF also voiced serious concern over the rising spread of the virus among health workers and resolved to work with the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) to ensure that health workers are ""adequately"" provided with personal protective equipment (PPE) and are ""constantly"" trained on the use of protective gears.

This followed an update from the NGF Secretariat on the number of COVID-19 cases in the country.

Governors also resolved to set up COVID-19 committees at the regional level, headed by their State Commissioners of Health in order to strengthen coordinated implementation of necessary public health recommendations across States.

Regional committees, the communique added, will continue to interface with the State Task Force Committees on COVID-19 already established in each State.

The NGF Chairman briefed the forum on the rapidly evolving situation of the COVID-19 pandemic and coordination efforts with the federal government, multilateral and bilateral partners, and the private sector through the Coalition against COVID-19 (CACOVID).

The forum held a minute's silence in honour of all Nigerians who had lost their lives from coronavirus, especially health workers who were in the front lines of the epidemic.

The NGF also congratulated the governor of Kaduna State, Nasir El-Rufai, who after nearly four weeks of testing positive and observing very strict medical regime, has now received two consecutive negative test results for the coronavirus.

Members also conveyed their condolence to President Muhammadu Buhari and the people of Borno State on the passing of the Chief of Staff to the President, Malam Abba Kyari, who passed away on April 17, 2020 in the line of duty to the country.

It would be recalled that President Buhari currently imposed lockdown in only the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Lagos and Ogun States to halt the spread of the novel pandemic coronavirus.

Some of the States have taken similar measures to fight the deadly virus but there is no nationwide lockdown from the federal government.

Health experts say the country may be heading towards the need for nationwide lockdown to stop the virus.

However, the National Coordinator of the Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19, Dr. Sani Aliyu, had earlier in the day denied proposing a national lockdown to tackle COVID-19 in the country.

Aliyu made the claim on Wednesday in Abuja, at the 17th joint national briefing of the PTF on COVID-19.

That came after the Director-General, Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, Chikwe Ihekweazu hinted on Monday that President Buhari will make some very difficult decisions next week about the lockdown occasioned by the coronavirus pandemic.

He said this in Katsina when he visited Governor Aminu Masari to see the state's preparedness for COVID 19.

The audio of the discussion by the duo was obtained by our correspondent.

Ihekweazu disclosed that the president was scheduled to join the governors' forum teleconference meeting to discuss some of the decisions.

As at Tuesday 21 April, 2020, the official cases in the country stand at 782."

Of course, there’s the mustache that — combined with former Washington State coach Mike Leach‘s air-raid offense — inspired Minshew Mania during his college days, which carried over a bit into the NFL. He’s got the longer hair and headband that helps him bear quite a resemblance to Uncle Rico from Napoleon Dynamite. He’s got some wild outfits, including a fab Christmas-themed one.

And then there are the jorts, Minshew’s already iconic jean shorts that he’s previously said he makes himself. What a legend.

Minshew added another layer to that status Thursday in a tweet wishing the 2020 NFL Draft prospects luck hours before the first pick. The Jacksonville Jaguars quarterback shared a photo of him shirtless and wearing only jorts and sunglasses while on the phone, implying that was the moment he learned he was selected in the sixth round of the 2019 NFL Draft as the No. 178 overall pick.

He described it as: “One of the best days and calls ever!”

What a way to find out you’ve been drafted. It’s obviously not as famous as Brett Farve’s infamous jorts (or Baker Mayfield’s recreation of that photo), but perhaps it could reach that level some day.

But it’s a quintessential Gardner Minshew look now that the quarterback has become a fan favorite beyond the college football world after his rookie season in Jacksonville.

Back in September, Minshew revealed that he “absolutely” cuts his own jorts because, obviously.

Interestingly, the discount rate at the index’s Feb. 19 high of 3,386, was 6.2%. In the two months since, the discount rate has risen to 10%, almost identical to its long-term average of 9.8%.

If the S&P 500 is overvalued by as much as 35%, many of its component stocks must be as well:

Using cash flow and free cash flow valuation metrics (price-to-sales and price-to-free-cash flow), I’ve selected 10 S&P 500 stocks that I believe are overvalued and should be sold.

There is no question that most of InvestorPlace’s contributors are bullish about Advanced Micro Devices’ future. I’m not quite as upbeat, and the reason has everything to do with its valuation.

In my last article about AMD, I said that I didn’t think its stock was worth purchasing at current prices; it was trading around $58. It subsequently corrected like most stocks during the coronavirus-led meltdown, falling below $40 in late March. It has since rebounded back into the mid-to-high $50s.

In February, I also recommended that if you owned AMD, you shouldn’t sell it. Now that it’s come back up, I’m suggesting investors consider taking some profits.

If valuation weren’t a concern, I would agree with my colleagues that AMD is a “buy” at these prices. However, you could buy Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) at 38 times cash flow, and that company boasts much higher free cash flow generation to boot.

If and when AMD stock drops back into the $40s, it’ll present a much better opportunity for investors.

Citrix is currently trading at or near an all-time high. InvestorPlace’s Luke Lango recently recommended the company because its application virtualization software solutions allow employees to work from home more efficiently. Furthermore, the trend likely won’t go away once workers head back to the office in a few months.

In June 2019, I recommended investors consider Citrix’s stock because it was trading within 3% of its 52-week low. Since then, it’s up 57%.

“Citrix’s Intelligent Workspace is a platform for company applications that operate intelligently to improve productivity,” I wrote last June. “The company’s goal is to provide enough productivity improvements through its platform to give users back one day of their work week lost to moving between applications.”

In the first quarter of 2019, Citrix’s subscription revenue grew 37% and accounted for almost 20% of its overall sales. For the entire fiscal 2019, Citrix’s subscription revenue grew by 43% and accounted for 22% of its total sales.

While Citrix’s transition to a subscription-based business model is smart, I just don’t think it’s accomplished enough to justify 25 times cash flow. At $150, you might want to take some profits off the table.

The data center real estate investment trust gained 15.7% in March compared to a 12.4% decline for the S&P 500. It’s not hard to see why the REIT had such a strong month. Everyone and their dog are working from home. The coronavirus has proven why the cloud is so vital to our economy.

With internet use surging, the fact that DLR owns 267 data centers in 20 countries and six different continents, is a big selling point for buying its stock.

However, as Warren Buffett likes to say, “Price is what you pay, value is what you get.”

Baird analyst David Rodgers recently downgraded DLR stock to neutral on valuation concerns. Rodgers “sees little or no upside” for DLR stock, suggesting that in the next two years, it is going to see a lot of tenants rolling over compared to other areas of commercial real estate.

Furthermore, while DLR is defensive in nature, it has significantly outperformed its REIT peers. Eventually, reversion to the mean is going to slow it down.

“Stocks in our coverage are already trading at robust valuations at or in excess of our fair value estimates that already included substantial credit for portfolio lease-up and new development,” Rodgers wrote April 13.

Based on the analysts’ comments, Digital Realty Trust has exceeded expectations. Time to sell.

A recent blog post from A Wealth of Common Sense highlighted the fact that 10 big tech stocks account for 23% of the entire U.S. stock market. This means that even massive companies such as Equinix account for the rest. The provider of retail, colocated data centers, has a $58 billion market cap and yet it’s on the outside looking in despite leasing space to some of the big tech stocks, including Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Facebook (NASDAQ: ).

Equinix stock has a year to date total return of 17.4% through April 16, 31 percentage points higher relative to the Morningstar U.S. Market Index. It’s one of the few bright spots in tech in 2020.

There is no question that Equinix’s leading position in the data center industry provides it with a rich valuation; it trades at 26 times adjusted funds from operations (AFFO), 30% higher than the industry average. Part of its attraction at this point has to do with the fact it tends to outperform in periods of market turbulence.

However, if DLR is expensive at 19 times cash flow, EQIX is overbought at 26x cash flow.

A total of 13 analysts cover Jack Henry, a provider of data processing solutions to more than 1,000 banks and financial institutions. Of the analysts covering the company, only two have an “overweight” or “buy” rating on JKHY stock. More importantly, the average target price is $160.50, 3% lower than where it’s currently trading.

On April 3, Jack Henry announced that it had rolled out its Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) solution that enables lenders to offer digital applications that can be filled out online by loan applicants and given conditional approval for PPP loans.

Digital solutions from companies like Jack Henry are great to have, but if the Small Business Administration has run out of the $349 billion in allotted funds, it doesn’t matter how good they are.

Further, companies such as PayPal (NASDAQ: ) could have helped get the funds to small businesses more expediently. Unfortunately, the federal government didn’t approve their participation until April 10, a week after the PPP began accepting applications.

Speaking of PayPal, it is trading at 7.2 times sales and 28.2 times cash flow, which is cheaper than Jack Henry.

If you can own PayPal for the same valuation as Jack Henry, why wouldn’t you swap out one for the other? That’s what I would do.

Morgan Stanley analyst David Risinger downgraded Eli Lilly April 9 from overweight to equal-weight on valuation concerns. The analyst kept his target price at $148, which translates to a 4.3% downside over the next 12 months.

On March 23, Eli Lilly provided an update on its clinical trials during Covid-19.

While the company admitted that the novel coronavirus pandemic had affected its ability to continue its clinical trials, it did not see the need to change its guidance for 2020, despite many other pharmaceutical companies saying there exist many Covid-19 uncertainties.

Risinger suggested Lilly has performed well because it generates significant revenue from outpatient drugs that faceless Covid-related disruptions than those drugs dispensed in a hospital or through a doctor.

Eli Lilly historically has had a price-to-earnings ratio that’s higher than its peers. However, its current P/E premium is higher than at almost any time in its history. As for its price-to-sales and price-to-cash-flow, they are also much higher than their five-year averages.

With higher than usual unemployment possible in the next 12-18 months, the company faces a risk of lower U.S. commercial drug coverage.

It significantly outperformed its peers over the past five years. Thus, its stock may be about to revert to the mean and turn lower.

Most of the companies that made this list did so because of valuation concerns, not because they aren’t excellent businesses. MSCI is a classic example.

In November 2019, I recommended MSCI stock as part of a 10-stock portfolio, where the first letter of each stock’s corporate name spelled out the word “RETIREMENT.” MSCI was the letter M. At the time; it was trading around $249. Since then, MSCI’s value has increased by 29% despite 2020’s major correction in the entire U.S. market.

What struck me at the time of my recommendation was how strong its performance had been over the previous five years. It had an annualized total return of 39% compared to 9% for the iShares MSCI USA Equal Weighted ETF (NYSEARCA: ).

Five months later, MSCI has a five-year annualized total return of 39% compared to 4% for EUSA. While MSCI has managed to go sideways over these five months, EUSA’s five-year return has dropped by 500 basis points.

So, why the “sell” recommendation?

Well, it’s not so much a “sell” recommendation for those who already own the stock, but rather a “don’t buy now” suggestion for those considering buying in.

That’s because MSCIs price-to-sales and price-to-cash-flow ratios are 1.7x and 1.4x their 5-year average. Further, its PEG ratio is 3.65, 1.7x its five-year average.

MSCI is priced for perfection. A lengthy recession will likely take care of that.

As if Netflix doesn’t already have enough competitors, come July 15, it’ll have one more: NBC is rolling out its Peacock streaming service across the U.S. this summer.

The added competition is one of several reasons why Benchmark analyst Matthew Harrigan recently initiated coverage of the world’s leading streaming service with a “sell” rating. He also has a $327 target price, 23% lower than where NFLX currently trades.

“Despite high customer additions and lower churn, we are concerned with mounting streaming competition, potentially restricted pricing power from a global economic downturn and surveys suggesting that streaming services are among the first household budget items to be cut with job losses,” Harrigan wrote in a note to clients.

In addition to all the issues mentioned above, Harrigan’s concerned that if the Covid-19 crisis carries on into 2021, Netflix won’t have enough content to keep pace with competitors who have more in-depth libraries.

The last time I wrote about Netflix in January, I was very bullish about its ability to compete with the NBCs of the world. What I didn’t factor into my “buy” recommendation was the coronavirus outbreak. At the time, I thought NFLX stock was cheaper from a valuation perspective than it had ever been, save for Aug. 2019 when it was trading around $250.

Today, my “sell” recommendation is based on the fact Netflix faces more headwinds than investors realize, and perhaps the run it’s been on is about to hit a wall.

Ultimately, I believe the company will get over that wall, but for now, I see little upside for NFLX stock.

Regeneron is trading at levels not seen since Nov. 2015. Anyone who bought back then and is still holding is sitting on zero gains. That’s 54 months with nothing to show for it. It is these people that have got to be thrilled about the gains it’s made in 2020 as a result of its work to develop a coronavirus treatment.

On April 17, Benchmark analyst Aydin Huseynov upgraded Regeneron stock to a “buy” from “hold” on news the biotech company could make a cocktail of antibodies to protect health care workers until a proper vaccine is available. This move would generate as much as $50 billion in revenue for Regeneron in 2021.

Also, the Food and Drug Administration fast-tracked Regeneron’s approval process April 16 for its cocktail of antibodies, which were initially intended for the Ebola virus.

That said, clinical trials don’t start until June. Furthermore, although the analyst has upped his rating of REGN stock to “buy,” he admits that the cocktail’s chances of success are 50/50.

So, Regeneron is up 44% in 2020, with half those gains in the past month alone. Those are significant gains in a down market. Unless you can afford to lose all of your gains to date, I would consider taking profits.

If you’re one of those people who’s owned REGN since 2015, you better hope the company’s cocktail wins the day. If not, you’ll be back underwater in no time.

InvestorPlace contributor Matt McCall recommended in November 2018 that SBA Communications, an owner of more than 30,000 cell towers in North America and South America, was an excellent stock to play the 5G revolution. It’s up 88% in the 18 months since.

The great thing about SBAs business is that no matter what happens in the 5G revolution, cell towers are still a necessary part of the technology. Until someone figures out how to eliminate cell towers, SBAC is a real estate investment trust that is going to attract a lot of attention.

That’s why it’s up 28% in 2020, while the markets as a whole have a total return of -14%.

Interestingly, of the 15 analysts covering SBAC stock, 11 have it as a “buy” and another gives it an “overweight” rating. Yet, its average 12-month target price is $309.93, suggesting there is little potential for upside over the next year.

As I like to say, you’ve always got options.

American Tower (NYSE: ), which owns 180,000 cell towers around the world, has price-to-sales and price-to-cash-flow ratios of 14.8x and 29.9x, respectively. Those are both lower than SBAC.

So, like MSCI, it’s not so much that I think SBAC is a “sell,” but rather that it is priced for perfection, and thus likely to see a bit of a correction over the next 6-12 months.

Despite local emergency orders against evictions and restrictions included the CARES Act enacted last month, many unemployed workers in New Orleans, Louisiana and many other states are receiving eviction notices from landlords and being thrown out on the street in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic.

Thousands of workers in New Orleans have lost their jobs, many of them working in the city’s vibrant service industry, and are now dependent upon slow and more often than not insufficient state and federal aid in order to pay rent and buy food and medicine and other essentials.

In the face of massive layoffs and economic uncertainty facing nearly half the New Orleans workforce following a mandatory lockdown to slow the spread of COVID-19 in a city that has been hit particularly hard by the highly contagious virus, Mayor LaToya Cantrell ordered a ban on evictions beginning in mid-March. However, this week she had to issue a reminder in the face of a recent rash of eviction notices and threatening actions by multiple landlords across the city.

One out-of-work restaurant worker, Johnquil Kelley, told WWLTV last week about her experience with her landlord Joshua Bruno, who rents her an Algier area apartment. Having lost her job in mid-March, when the city finally issued stay at home orders and shut down many restaurants and virtually every bar in the interest of public safety, Kelley was hoping to work with Bruno on April’s rent and was faced with a eviction notice for her trouble.

Instead she received a note on her door which read, “Three Day Notice To Pay Or Vacate. Demand for possession is hereby made. You are hereby given notice to PAY or vacate the dwelling on or before midnight of the 2nd day of this notice.” The note from Bruno demanded the full amount of rent plus late fees.

Kelley was reportedly trying to get some leeway on the rent by attempting to reason with her landlord, “I'm still waiting on a stimulus check, and I'm still waiting on my unemployment—anything, something—so I can pay him his rent,” Kelley explained to reporters. “But he still put the notice on the door.”

“Receiving a bright red notice to vacate in three days is an intimidation tactic that is going to cause some tenant to move when they really don't have to right now,” Hannah Adams, an attorney who works for a local legal service for those who can’t afford lawyers, told WWLTV in response to Kelley’s eviction notice. “Moving right now means you are exposing yourself to potential infection with the coronavirus.”

Bruno reportedly sent out several other eviction notices and had been the subject of several tenant complaints in regards to neglecting appliances and maintaining his units.

While the CARES Act also prohibits evictions by property owners such as Bruno who receive federal subsidies through the end of July, there have been multiple instances in New Orleans and around the country of landlords sending eviction notices as a bullying tactic to force out or squeeze rent payments from of poor and unemployed workers.

Another New Orleans man, Robert Stephenson, was actually evicted from his home, along with his girlfriend, when their service industry incomes both disappeared immediately following the lockdown.

Stephenson, who is diabetic and a veteran, was still in the process of applying for disability benefits when the owners of the guesthouse that he and his girlfriend were living in told them to vacate immediately.

Fearing a clash with police if they resisted, they left the house and Stephenson was left homeless, sleeping under the Claiborne Avenue bridge that very same day. Southeastern Legal Services, the same attorneys who represented Kelley in her claim against her landlord, are now assisting Stephenson in getting his medications and in pursuing punitive damages against his landlord for their illegal eviction.

According to the National Multifamily Housing Council only 69 percent of those living in apartments had made their rent payments by April 5. Across the country, housing attorneys have seen a massive increase in landlords seeking to carry out illegal evictions ever since the COVID-19 related economic collapse hit last month.

Since courts across the country have closed, including the Orleans Parish Civil District Court which closed on March 16, most evictions and notices are illegal, whether that includes threatening notes or changing of locks or in some cases removing doors from hinges, because the landlords have not gone through the proper legal proceedings.

According to attorneys with the Public Interest Law Center in Philadelphia, landlords have taken it upon themselves to illegally enforce eviction measures that are normally enforced by the local sheriff’s departments.

Most states have issued moratoriums on all evictions as well as utility shutoffs, however, according to law professor Emily Benfer there are some states that still allow landlords to send eviction notices even if a lawful eviction is prohibited. Landlords often use these notices as a threatening tactic, counting on the tenants to move out on their own.

The CARES Act provision blocking evictions only applies to the about one-in-four rental properties which are backed by federal mortgage securities. For the other renters, they are forced to rely on state and city bans for protection from eviction, which are, for the most part, inconsistently and sporadically enforced as only twenty states are temporarily banning law enforcement from carrying out the final stage of the eviction process, the forcible removal of the tenant.

Many states have banned the court stage of the eviction and some are banning the initial stage, the eviction notice, but only a few states have actually implemented on every stage of the eviction, leaving many out-of-work renters vulnerable during this disastrous economic downturn. With more than 22 million currently out of work, this leaves many at risk of being made homeless.

Despite these various bans, for thousands of workers across the country who are already in tenuous living situations such as temporary housing or hotel residencies, the prospect of filling up homeless shelters during a pandemic is especially dangerous. Situations such as these only exacerbate the damage the outbreak will have, and each eviction is a social crime."

- They were sent by Kano state to their state of origins

- This is also in efforts to curtail the spread of coronavirus

The Katsina state government has received 419 almajiris evacuated by Kano state government to their state of origins as part of measures to prevent the spread of Covid-19.

The Director of Press in the office of the Secretary to Government of the State (SGS), Alhaji Abdullahi Yar’adua, disclosed this in a statement made available to journalists on Wednesday in Katsina.

The statement asserted that the SGS, Alhaji Mustapha Inuwa, received the almajiris on behalf of the state government.

Inuwa was quoted to have expressed happiness that Katsina and Kano were now taking the same measures toward curtailing the spread of COVID-19 in the two states.

He explained that the state government had already closed down both Islamiyya and Qur’anic schools, and returned the almajiris to their parents including those from Niger Republic.

He thanked the Kano state government for making adequate arrangements in profiling and quarantining the almajiris before handing them over.

The SGS announced that all the children would be taken to the NYSC camp in Katsina for another round of health examinations.

After this, they would be transported back to their various local governments across the state.

He strongly advised parents to desist from sending their wards to unknown places thereby exposing them to social dangers under the guise of seeking for religious knowledge.

Meanwhile, Legit.ng had reported that the wife of Kebbi state governor, Hajiya Aisha Abubakar Bagudu has promised that her foundation, Mass Literacy for The Less Privileged and the Almajiris Initiative (MALLPAI), would continue to cater for the poor in the society.

Hajiya Bagudu stated this on Saturday, January 11, during the 10th year anniversary of the MALLPAI held in the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja.

Speaking during a panel session at the event, Hajiya Bagudu assured that her foundation will continue to give back to society through the foundation.

She also revealed that MALLPAI foundation has commenced training of teachers and mallams in northern Nigeria.

“We are training them into the new system so that they will able to train the young ones. Without primary school education, we don't have anything because that's the base.

“We are also training the Islamic schools as well, the mallams there. So that they will be able also to teach those children properly,’’ she said.

She revealed that most of the foundation workers are volunteers without pay, stating that they work without being paid.

According to her, the volunteers are mostly working for the foundation due to the passion they have for less privileged children in the society.

“Passion alone drives any initiative in the society,’’ she added.

Actor John Cho has expressed concerned over the racial hatred against the Asian-American community in America, saying coronavirus pandemic has made the community realise that their ""belonging is conditional"" in the US.In the essay published in the",www.business-standard.com,"Actor John Cho has expressed concerned over the racial hatred against the Asian-American community in America, saying coronavirus pandemic has made the community realise that their ""belonging is conditional"" in the US.

In the essay published in the Los Angeles Times, the 47-year-old actor highlighted how the community finds itself at the receiving end of hate due to COVID-19.

""I called my parents a few nights ago to tell them to be cautious when stepping out of the house, because they might be targets of verbal or even physical abuse. It felt so strange. Our roles had flipped,"" Cho wrote.

""The fact that the coronavirus seems to have originated in China has spawneda slew of anti-Asian hate crimes. Across the country, Asian American parents and children are making versions of the call I made. Friends are sharing first-hand accounts of abuse on text chains and circulating articles on Facebook, always ending with the suddenly ominous stay safe,"" he added.

Cho, whocame to the US from South Korea when he was six and was naturalised in 1990, said his parents would always tell him to ""act like the natives"", hoping that ""race would not disadvantage us."" 



""In some ways, I began to lead a life devoid of race. But I've learned that a moment always comes along to remind you that your race defines you above all else,"" he added.

The actor, who became a star after featuring in ""Harold and Kumar"" series with Kal Penn, recalled how things became difficult for his co-star post 9/11 attacks.

Cho said that Penn was unfairly treated at airports and subjected to ""random checks"" by security personnel, while others were allowed to pass through without any hassle.

""Asian Americans are experiencing such a moment right now. The pandemic is reminding us that our belonging is conditional. One moment we are Americans, the next we are all foreigners, who 'brought' the virus here,"" he added.

The actor further said most Asian stereotypes tend to be complimentary and people believe it is ""somehow less serious, that it's racism lite"".

But it also allows them to ""dismiss the current wave of Asian hate crimes as trivial, isolated and unimportant. Consider the comedians who mock Asians, but restrain themselves when it comes to other groups."" 



""If the coronavirus has taught us anything, it's that the solution to a widespread problem cannot be patchwork. Never has our interconnectedness and our reliance on each other been plainer.

""You can't stand up for some and not for others. And like the virus, unchecked aggression has the potential to spread wildly. Please don't minimise the hate or assume it's somewhere far away. It's happening close to you. If you see it on the street, say something. If you hear it at work, say something. If you sense it in your family, say something. Stand up for your fellow Americans,"" Cho concluded."

He said lifting of the lockdown is nowhere in sight and as such banning liquor sales will impact state revenues. ""Since 18th March, our state is in a lockdown phase. First, the deadline was March 31, then extended to April 14, now it stands at May 3. How long will this lockdown phase keep getting extended cannot be ascertained,"" he said.

Thackeray said that opening liquor shops does not mean that the government is looking after the needs of alcohol consumers but is only aiming to ""to start the process of income flow into the shrinking revenue"" of the state.

""The excise duty generated for the state via liquor amounts to Rs 41.66 crore daily, or Rs 1,250 crore monthly and around Rs 14,000 crore yearly,"" Thackeray pointed out.

He said that the state should not concern itself with moral issues. ""It's not that there was a liquor ban in our state and we are asking to remove that. Prior to lockdown, the wine shops were open. The state government should not try to get caught in some moral issues at such a crucial time and take the necessary action,"" Thackeray said in the letter.

Raj Thackeray argued that the police force and healthcare workers do not have PPE kits. Additionally necessary requirements such as free meal services are not met.

The MNS chief also said that low budget restaurants and outlets must be allowed to function. ""There are so many low budget small restaurants, canteens wherein one has access to the affordable and humble 'rice plate'...There are many homes which are not equipped with cooking staff and many homes would not even have the necessary supplies and requirements needed for cooking,"" he wrote.

He also said that adhering to the norms of the lockdown is the responsibility of the hotel owners. ""To face this corona pandemic, the citizens will cooperate but the government too needs to ensure a decent and liveable life to its citizens in return,"" he added.

The severe weather continued into the overnight hours as damage reports rained in from Oklahoma, Texas and Louisiana. According to the National Weather Service (NWS) Storm Prediction Center, 27 separate tornado reports were issued on Thursday.

Madill, Oklahoma, was hit by one of numerous tornadoes in the southern Plains on Wednesday amid the severe weather outbreak. The city, situated in southern Oklahoma about 100 miles north of Dallas, Texas, sustained significant damage, and Marshall County officials, according to KXII TV, blamed at least two deaths on tornadoes that struck the area.

The severe thunderstorms developed south of Oklahoma City right along Interstate 35, igniting just a few hours after a hailstorm hammered the state’s capital.

The first tornado was reported near Springer, Oklahoma, before tracking east. Not long after, around 5 p.m. CDT, another twister touched down and tracked directly through Madill, crossing Highway 377 in the process.

Video from Lake Durant, Oklahoma, captured the moment a tornado touched down in front of a rainbow. Filmed by Durant resident Hayden Baker, the footage depicts hail falling in the foreground while the twister churns behind a set of houses.

Prior to Wednesday, there had only been four tornadoes reported in Oklahoma all year, according to the Storm Prediction Center (SPC).

Shortly after the deadly tornado hit Madill, a large tornado was reported in Polk County, Texas, about 80 miles north of Houston. Reports said multiple people were trapped and injured after 30 to 40 mobile homes were damaged following the tornado. Other buildings were damaged and large trees blocked roads as well as overturned semis.

Polk County Emergency Management confirmed 20-30 injuries and at least three deaths as of early Thursday morning, with search and rescue efforts ongoing.

Severe damage was also reported in Jasper, Texas, after a possible tornado touched down in the early evening hours on Wednesday.

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said in a statement that local and government agencies are working to provide immediate support to those affected by the tornadoes.

""Our hearts are with our fellow Texans tonight and the state will continue to do everything it can to support those affected by this severe weather,"" Abbott said.

In Polk County, Texas, drone footage captured the widespread devastation of the area, located about 80 miles north of Houston. Throughout the county, roofs were ripped off houses, trees were snapped and cars were damaged.

The tornado in Polk County is suspected to be the result of an EF2 twister based on the survey findings of the NWS office in Lake Charles, Louisiana.

There were multiple tornado emergencies on Wednesday night as the severe storms shifted eastward. The NWS confirmed a large and extremely dangerous tornado 7 miles south of Alexandria, Louisiana, before 10 p.m. CDT. This storm remained tornado-warned as it neared the Louisiana-Mississippi border over 30 minutes later.

Officials confirmed the death of a woman in Woodworth in connection to the storms, the Rapides Parish Sheriff's Office told KALB.com. Another Louisiana fatality was confirmed by DeSoto Parish Sheriff Jayson Richardson who reported that a man was found dead after he tried to retrieve a trash can from water near a drainage ditch, Richardson told The Shreveport Times according to The Associated Press.

Law enforcement reported that there was significant damage to buildings on the campus of Louisiana State University of Alexandria, which is located about 10 miles south of downtown Alexandria. The university stated on Twitter that all resident students were unharmed.

The SPC has recorded 26 preliminary tornadoes from Wednesday and Wednesday night. This number may change as storm surveys are completed in the days ahead.

Baseball-sized hail also battered the region. Hailstones this large can easily dent cars and break windshields.

The threat for severe thunderstorms and tornadoes will shift eastward on Thursday across the southeastern U.S."

The South Korean panel maker posted its fifth straight quarter of operating losses, as the coronavirus pandemic added to the problems of the industry already grappling with demand falls and a supply glut.

LG Display posted an operating loss of 362 billion won ($294.70 million), better than Refinitiv SmartEstimate’s 390 billion won loss, but nearly triple the operating loss of 132 billion won a year earlier.

LG Display said an increase in working from home and online activities meant demand for products such as monitors, laptops and tablets would increase in the second quarter, but it might not be enough to offset weak demand for TVs and smartphones.

“We expect volatility in demand to increase down the road,” LG Display said.

Analysts also said the spread of the coronavirus across the globe would lead to further losses.

“It’s likely that LG Display will continue to have another quarterly loss, reflecting the impact of the coronavirus on North America and Europe, which now have become its epicentre,” Park Kang-ho, an analyst at Daishin Securities, said.

LG Display’s shares ended up 0.5% versus the wider market’s fall of 0.98%. Its earnings announcement was issued after the market close.

The flat-screen maker also said it delayed production at its new Chinese factory for its advanced organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display to the second quarter, citing difficulties in deploying technical staff because of travel restrictions caused by COVID-19. It had aimed to start production at the factory in Guangzhou in the first quarter.

Although liquid crystal display (LCD) panel prices rose when production was disrupted in China at the peak of the coronavirus outbreak there, the price increases were shortlived as Chinese rivals resumed production, contributing to a supply glut.

Prices for LG Display’s main product, 50-inch LCDs for television sets, rose just over 1% in the quarter from the previous quarter, data from WitsView, part of research provider TrendForce, showed.

To try to stem losses, LG Display has said it will halt domestic production of LCD TV panels by the end of this year.

Samsung Display, a unit of Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, said last month it would end all production of LCD panels by the end of this year."

Dr Maninder Bawa, posted as medical officer (ophthalmology) at Kot Ise Khan, had in a written submission on March 31 conveyed to her seniors that she was ‘stranded’ in Coimbatore – where she had gone to attend a training programme – due to the lockdown, and hence cannot join duty.

Her submission (a copy of which is with The Indian Express) to senior medical officer (SMO) Kot Ise Khan on March 31 via WhatsApp, Dr Bawa wrote: “… I had come here to attend a training programme from February 1 to March 31 at Aravind Eye Hospital, Coimbatore. Due to lockdown my flight scheduled for April 1 has been cancelled indefinitely…”

Her husband Dr Gagandeep Singh, is also posted at Moga Civil Hospital.

On Thursday, Moga Deputy Commissioner Sandeep Hans told The Indian Express that Dr Gagandeep had been given an “inter-state curfew movement pass” which was valid from April 13 to 23 to go and get his wife back, but “they refused to avail it”. “No one from her family went to pick her up from Coimbatore,” said Hans.

When The Indian Express contacted Dr Bawa at 5 pm on Thursday, she said no one from her family can come to pick her up as it is not possible to “travel 3,000 km by road” from Punjab to Tamil Nadu. Hence, she will come back on May 5 via an Indigo flight booked by her husband.

“My flights earlier scheduled for April 14 and 16 were cancelled. It wasn’t possible for my family to travel 3,000 km, hence we did not avail the pass issued by DC office. I am still in Coimbatore and now I will return on May 5. My husband cannot come pick me up.”

However, three hours later, at 8 pm pm, her husband Dr Gagandeep called this correspondent and said he has already reached Coimbatore to pick up his wife. “We will reach Punjab latest by Saturday morning,” he added.

Asked how he had travelled via road from Moga to Coimbatore in three hours, he said, “I had left for Coimbatore from Moga two days back. We got to know that the Indigo flight for May 5 is also being cancelled so I decided to travel and get my wife back. She won’t be able to join duty immediately as we will quarantine her first.”

Moga Civil Surgeon Dr Andesh Kang said the couple won’t be allowed to join duty without an inquiry.

“It all appears to be a big lie. I suspect the involvement of other senior officials too. Dr Rajesh Attri, senior medical officer, Moga Civil Hospital, has been asked to get a written undertaking from Dr Gagandeep saying that his wife was in Coimbatore ever since and he went to pick her up. If she is willfully not joining duty during this crisis, it is gross negligence and unacceptable. Action will be taken if it is proved that she was back home but still evaded duty.”

Speaking to The Indian Express, Moga Deputy Commissioner Sandeep Hans said, “After she gave a written submission, we issued an inter-state curfew movement pass to her husband to get her back home so she can join work. The pass was issued for ten days from April 13 to 23 so she can come back via road. However, they did not avail the pass facility and no one went to get her back. She hasn’t joined yet. We arranged the pass, but if the family did not avail it, how can we do anything?” Dr Rakesh Bali, SMO, Kot Ise Khan, said, “She sent us this application on March 31 saying she is stranded in Coimbatore. I forwarded the same to civil surgeon…”

This transition to online coursework",www.kunr.org,"There are 21,000 students enrolled at the University of Nevada, Reno, and all of their courses have been moved online. This transition to online coursework has resulted in some growing pains. KUNR’s Jayden Perez checked in with students and professors at UNR, to gauge their reactions to the changes at the university.

Matt Henderson is in his first year of postgraduate work at UNR. The medical engineering student used to rely on in-class lectures for help with the material, but when the university transitioned, he’s had to approach his work differently.

“I have been [almost] entirely relegated to working from the online materials and working from the lecture slides. That really takes away a lot of the important context and really key information, not only for what is being presented but for how to interpret it all,” said Henderson.

Henderson also said that he appreciated the work done by professors and staff in helping students adjust. However, he did take issue with some of the administration’s choices and how they handled their response to the novel coronavirus pandemic.

“I think that the administration still had a lot of things that they were playing catch up with. That not only did they not have a plan for the coronavirus, but they didn’t have any kind of plan for a university shutdown in any context,” said Henderson.

Junior journalism major Michelle Werdann was studying abroad at Maastricht University in the Netherlands this semester. She was surprised by how quickly the pandemic changed everything. Though she’s now back in Reno, she still has to work off of Maastricht’s time.

“My other professor has kept the final exam and I actually have to be up at four in the morning to start that exam, because it’s due at seven,” said Werdann. “So four my time.”

As of now, classes at UNR are scheduled to remain online until the end of the first summer session on July 10. Some students have voiced concerns over that decision, but Associate Professor of Voice and Opera Albert Lee is seeing something different occur with his students.

“Several students have made some incredible breakthroughs in their own musical development and part of that is they have more time to actually process information,” said Lee.

In spite of the growth that Lee’s students are experiencing, the current situation poses problems involving music. Computer microphones have difficulty capturing the feel of a live performance and Lee has worked to keep things consistent.

“When you are trying to deal with music via Zoom, adjusting the settings and having quality microphones enhances the experience for both students and instructor alike. There are certainly some challenges, but classes have continued with as much normality as possible,"" said Lee.

Administration officials said they’re planning to reopen the campus by the second summer session, but that could change depending on the pandemic.

As a note of disclosure, the license to this station is owned by the Board of Regents for the Nevada System of Higher Education.

 Associated Press

 LANSING — The Republican-led Michigan Legislature on Tuesday lengthened Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s coronavirus emergency declaration by 23 days, through April, rather than adopt the 70-day extension that she had sought.

 At their first session in three weeks, mask-wearing lawmakers kept distance from each other as they approved the shorter extension by voice vote, after undergoing screening steps to enter the Senate and House chambers. Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist II, who presides over the Senate, wore an “Everybody Vs COVID-19”î shirt.

 Senate leaders later announced a bipartisan work group that will recommend to Whitmer how to reopen parts of the economy as long as proper social-distancing procedures are followed. She is expected to extend her stay-at-home order beyond April 13 soon.

 Whitmer’s original emergency declaration is the basis for roughly 30 executive orders, including those closing businesses and prohibiting large gatherings. Michigan had nearly 19,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases as of Tuesday with 845 deaths.

 Republicans said they had to act Tuesday or else Whitmer’s emergency declaration would expire under the terms of a 1976 law requiring legislative authorization to continue governor-issued emergencies or disasters.

 Whitmer did not disagree, at least as it relates to ensuring health care workers and first responders are protected from legal liability during the virus outbreak.

 But she noted that a 1945 law, also cited in her declarations and orders, gives a governor broad emergency powers without any legislative oversight. Democrats, who accused the GOP of “political posturing,” said legislators did not need to vote until April 29 because Whitmer issued a new order last week that also includes a disaster declaration.

 Whitmer said she disagreed with Republicans’ refusal to extend the emergency beyond April but “that’s their decision. They can come back as much as they want to, even though it’s contrary to all of the best practices that our medical professionals and epidemiologists are telling them. I do worry about their safety.î”

 Two lawmakers have tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, while a third has died of suspected COVID-19.

 Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey, a Clarklake Republican, said it was unnecessary to extend the emergency by 70 days into June, noting that legislators could later decide to continue it for longer. He also said agreeing to a 70-day extension of the emergency declaration could have inadvertently left the public with the impression that the stay-home order would also last into June.

 “Doing it in a stepped, incremental way makes more sense,î” Shirkey said.

 For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, or death.

 By April 17, senators from both parties will make recommendations to the governor on transitioning people back to work. Republicans told reporters there is evidence that employees can be just as safe on the job as at home, and some businesses — like lawn-service companies — can operate safely with no risk, while other operations, such as a rock concert, must remain a no-no for now.

 “I believe we will identify businesses and commercial activities even as early as next week that with very little change and very little effort, they can be deemed safe and begin to slowly ramp up economic activity in Michigan and do it in a safe way,î” Shirkey said.

 Also Tuesday, House Democratic Leader Christine Greig of Farmington Hills urged GOP leaders to let members meet remotely and electronically for session and committee hearings.

 “This is the time for the Legislature to lead, not shut down because we’re not using the communication tools designed just for this purpose,î” she said."
444,444,https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/Decarbonizing-US-Electricity-For-25-A-Year.html,Decarbonizing U.S. Electricity For $25 A Year,"The U.S. electricity industry is aging and its infrastructure needs to be entirely revamped, and there is a way we could do it with a surprisingly small price tag",oilprice.com,"In our fractious domestic politics, squabbles over infrastructure spending are as old the republic. But here we propose an infrastructure project of considerable scope that the country needs and which would not require governmental assistance. The US electricity industry (utilities and other providers), we calculate, will have to spend $7-8 trillion in order to modernize (the average plant is about 35 years old) and to eliminate its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

The sectors most likely to continue to decarbonize, moving away from extensive fossil fuel use, are electricity production and vehicular transportation and freight movement. In theory, electric vehicles could be powered by electricity produced from coal-fired power stations which are still relatively prevalent across much of the nation, although there is no rationale to do so since running vehicles on coal-fired electricity would not reduce GHG emissions - just transfer them from the tailpipe to the smokestack at the power plant. Coal-fired electricity, however, will not get that market. And coal’s principal “enemy” in this struggle for market share is not environmentalism. It is natural gas which has become cheaper and cleaner to use as boiler fuel.

In this struggle, coal has already lost for a simple economic reason. In a commodity business like electricity, price is the only thing that matters. Now natural gas fired power generation faces price competition from renewables, mostly wind, that produce electricity with zero fuel costs—the principal cost input for gas fired generation apart from capital. The only thing we can safely say here is that if present cost trends persist the penetration of renewables is likely to increase. And since the electricity fuel mix is something of a zero-sum game in a low growth environment ,that means that coal usage will trend to zero (as it did in the UK) and natural gas generators will have to struggle with ever cheapening renewables.

But switching gears for a moment, the reason electricity production is singled out for regulation is one of policy practicality. If mitigating pollution is the goal, it is easier for the government to regulate a few thousand large power plants than a few hundred million motor vehicles. And in doing so we could reduce the nation’s output of greenhouse gases by about 25 percent.

And this brings us to our favorite part of the discussion, namely, what will all this cost and how do we propose to pay for it? Up front electric utility industry capital spending would more than double – to $350–400 billion per year if this clean energy transition occurs over a period of 20 years. Current annual industry capital spending is about $150 billion per year.



Related: Oil Prices Hit $1 Following A 90% Crash

But there are two components to this forward-looking capital expenditure plan. First, much of our present electricity infrastructure is simply aging out and must be replaced, and the cost of a new utility plant far exceeds the cost of the original. Therefore, about two-thirds of the large so-called “green” capital replacement program would be devoted simply to modernizing aging assets in all aspects of the present power business - generation, transmission, and distribution. The bottom line? U.S. electricity industry capital spending will increase (assuming we wish to maintain present levels of service) even without a strong environmental push towards decarbonization.

If U.S. utilities committed to a refurbishment and decarbonization program this would elevate their prospective annual capital expenditures by at least $200 billion. This would significantly boost the U.S.’s non-financial corporate capital spending which totaled $2 trillion last year. This number for obvious pandemic related reasons is headed lower this year. And unlike the plethora of recently announced federal economic stimulus programs, this level of electricity capital expenditures once committed to would not evaporate once the present emergency recedes or political interest fades.

The next question is “Who would pay for this effort?” In the U.S. electricity business as presently structured, the answer is the customer. Costs of a new plant (like a thirty-year home mortgage) are spread out over the often very long lives of equipment. We calculate that in real terms the average electric bill would increase roughly 2 percent per year simply to modernize our present electricity industry and 4 percent annually to modernize and fully decarbonize.

These rough “ballpark” estimates may, in fact, overstate the total cost of decarbonization. Green power projects tend to be smaller than conventional baseload generation. And given present economics, smaller facilities tend to experience far fewer cost overruns than big, old-style power plants. This, in turn, lowers their investment risk and ultimately lowers their cost of capital as well.

Technological improvements have been coming in faster for renewables than for conventional facilities, too. In addition, a growing body of investors are seeking to fund specifically green projects and that demand also reduces industry capital costs. Furthermore, there is some indication that if the industry adopted a “half a loaf” strategy with respect to the elimination of greenhouse gas emissions, keeping a residuum of fossil-fired plants online to ensure reliability, it could further minimize planned cost increases.

Let’s stick to the 2 percent annual electricity price increase attributable to decarbonization for the sake of conservatism. This would cause average household electric bills in the U.S. to rise by about $25 per year. But here is the really startling statistic. As vital as electricity is to residential and industrial users alike, the revenues from this key industry equates to only 2 percent of U.S. gross domestic product. Stated differently, the typical residential electric bill totals only 2 percent of household income. If our estimates are even remotely accurate then paying for a clean, modern electricity system would barely impact most household budgets.

But the present Republican administration in Washington takes a rather lax view on pollution and potential polluters in general. What would encourage U.S. electricity producers, many of whom at least until recently were ardent climate change deniers to begin with, to move forward on a capital program of this size? A carbon tax? Sure, but not with the present leadership in Washington.

The states, however, under our bifurcated regulatory regime (states and the Feds both have authority) do have the power to influence both the price and the means of producing electricity. Long term capital plans, as well as authorized returns on shareholder equity, must be approved by state public utility commissions. Many have set renewable energy standards to encourage action, but these tend to remove carbon at a high cost.



Related: Saudi Supertankers Stranded As Oil Price War Backfires

But the state regulatory apparatus already exists to hasten this process and even make it more efficient. States can, for instance, offer accelerated asset retirements to encourage more rapid closure of existing fossil-fired power generating plants or grant companies a higher return on equity for those who produce or distribute low carbon electricity.

In our present age of minimal interest rates, even a small incremental boost leads to a big uptick in profits. A 1 percent bonus on sales of low carbon electricity, for instance, would raise pretax net income by a full 10 percent if fully implemented - a number that would undoubtedly enhance utility industry enthusiasm for decarbonization.

An accelerated capital investment program along the line suggested here would transform U.S. electric utility companies (and other electricity producers and suppliers) into the growth stocks they were in the 1950s and 1960s. In those halcyon days of yesteryear, the U.S.’s electric utilities offered investors both growth and income. Hard as it may be to believe there were electric companies included in the “Nifty Fifty”, an ancient precursor of today’s FANGs. Back then, the industry spent lavishly both to modernize and meet accelerating post-war demand - all while increasing margins due to increasing economies of scale.

There is an ongoing need in the investment community for companies that offer the unusual combination of growth and income. But apart from the needs of Wall Street, a capital program along the lines contemplated here should easily attract capital for this capital replacement/decarbonization spending marathon as well as boost the economy with years of steady investment. Collaterally this would stimulate demand for new technologies and workers locally to construct new plants. This would also reduce the nation’s greenhouse gas emissions by one fifth, directly, and enable electric vehicle users to run on green electricity, thereby reducing emissions perhaps by another fifth. Finally, this would modernize an aging electricity grid to meet the challenges of an energy-hungry digital economy in an increasingly challenging operating environment.

By the time our present pandemic related difficulties are over, the U.S. federal government alone will probably spend in excess of five or six trillion dollars supporting the economy. For roughly the same amount, we could rebuild the entire electricity infrastructure cleanly and with a price tag that most Americans would barely notice. And for the most part, it’s “shovel ready.”

A man fighting extradition back to Poland over violent jewellery robberies has failed in a new bid to have his case determined by the UK's highest court.

Piotr Kaim has been locked in a legal battle to serve out his jail sentence in Northern Ireland.

High Court judges in Belfast have already dismissed his bid to remain in this jurisdiction, stressing the need to prevent the UK being seen as a safe haven for fugitives.

They also declined to refer the case to the Court of Justice of the European Union.

Following that ruling last month, Kaim applied to certify a point of law of general public importance for a further appeal to the Supreme Court in London.

But Lord Justice Stephens has now held that a procedural question being posed does not require clarification.

He confirmed: ""The application for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court is refused.""

It represents a further blow in the wanted man's attempts to avoid extradition.

Kaim carried out at least four attacks on women on dates stretching back to 2012, the court heard.

He targeted victims by holding their faces and blocking their noses and mouths in order to steal jewellery.

Other women were grabbed around the neck and threatened as part of attempts to snatch their belongings.

In 2014 Kaim was ordered to serve two and a half years in prison for the offences.

But later that year he moved to Northern Ireland, by which stage he still had nearly two years left to serve on the term.

Extradition proceedings commenced by Polish authorities led to Kaim being detained in October 2019 under a European Arrest Warrant.

In November last year Belfast Recorder Judge McFarland ordered his return to Poland.

Kaim mounted a High Court appeal against that decision, claiming a failure to allow him to exercise his right to seek to serve the sentence in Northern Ireland.

His lawyers also contended that it was disproportionate to return him to Poland before his bid to remain behind bars in this jurisdiction was determined.

However, senior judges identified no strong, compelling factor to outweigh an otherwise ""inevitable extradition""."

By 12 March, WFP had registered 4,398 families (17,607 individuals). The registration exercises are currently suspended due to the implementation of the Enhanced Community Quarantine in Luzon to mitigate the spread of COVID-19."

With star left tackle Trent Williams insisting he wants to be traded, Washington has been working to deal him in recent weeks. So far, the Cleveland Browns, Minnesota Vikings, Philadelphia Eagles and New York Jets have shown the most interest, according to a person familiar with the discussions, but several factors have complicated the team’s ability to trade Williams, who has one year left on his contract. Prospective trade partners either haven’t been able to reach an agreement with Williams on a new deal, or they refuse to offer more than low-round draft picks in exchange for the seven-time Pro Bowl player.

The Browns, Vikings, and Jets have all been previously reported with varying levels of interest in the trade. Cleveland remains the front-runner to acquire Williams, unless they take a tackle with the #10 overall pick tonight. There have already been rumors that a trade was finalized yesterday, but nothing close to official has been reported. It’s most likely the deal won’t happen until later tonight.

Back to the Eagles showing interest in Trent Williams. This is new, and would likely not happen for many reasons. Philly needs help to keep Carson Wentz upright, and they let Jason Peters(who might end up replacing Williams for a year in Washington) leave in free agency. They drafted Andre Dillard in the first round last year, but he hasn’t exactly given them confidence so far.

Mike Florio from Pro Football Talk reports that there is zero truth to this rumor. This seemed odd when it came out early this morning, and it already seems like it’s dead on arrival. Trent Williams won’t be playing for the Philadelphia Eagles."

Delilah, Steve Rockford",northfloridanow.com,"LIVE OAK, FL —The Florida Department of Health in Suwannee County is reporting that the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the county has now reached 106. Their statement is as follows: 



The Florida Department of Health in Suwannee County (DOH-Suwannee) is now conducting its contact investigation and working on identifying and notifying individuals who will need to self-monitor for symptoms for a 14-day period. Contact investigations are a critical way for staff epidemiologists to track and prevent the spread of disease.

As Suwannee County sees increasing confirmed cases, DOH-Suwannee Administrator Mr. Kerry S. Waldron emphasized the importance of mitigation practices in preventing the spread of the virus.

'If we work together using smart mitigation practices, we can reduce COVID-19’s impact on our community,' Waldron said. 'We must practice social distancing, stay home when sick, frequently wash your hands for at least 20 seconds, cover coughs and sneezes, and follow CDC prevention guidelines to stop the spread of the virus.' Waldron emphasized it is imperative to limit unnecessary trips and remain at home.

Social distancing measures that have included the closure of schools and recommendations to cancel gatherings of more than 10 individuals are two of the ways that health officials hope to prevent the speed of the virus’ spread in the state. Preventing the speed and spread of the virus would 'flatten the curve' and prevent the overwhelming of our health care systems.

DOH-Suwannee has been monitoring COVID-19 since January and been in contact with Suwannee County Emergency Management and medical providers to prepare response activities in the event we were to see cases in Suwannee.

The symptoms of COVID-19 can mirror illnesses such as influenza. Patients with COVID-19 typically display symptoms such as fever (100.4°F or higher), cough, and/or shortness of breath within 2 to 14 days of exposure to the virus. Approximately 80% of those affected with COVID-19 report mild to moderate illness and experience a complete recovery. Some experience more severe illness. People who are more vulnerable to the illness include individuals who are over age 65 with underlying health conditions, immunocompromised, ill or have underlying chronic health conditions, such as heart disease or diabetes.

Many cases of COVID-19 can be managed at home by treating symptoms, and this is encouraged. However, if you develop worsening symptoms, such as shortness of breath, chest pain, or inability to drink fluids, contact 911 and advise them of your symptoms as you may need treatment at a hospital.

COVID-19 is a new type of coronavirus; coronaviruses are a large family of viruses, some causing illness in people and others that circulate among animals. Other coronaviruses include the common cold and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). COVID-19 is believed to have emerged from an animal source and is now capable of spreading from person-to-person. There is currently no vaccine to prevent COVID-19.

Hossein Salami, the IRGC commander-in-chief, said Thursday he had ordered his forces in the Gulf to destroy any vessel or combat unit that threatened the safety of Iranian ships, according to the Iranian Young Journalists Club news agency. Salami specifically referred to ""any American terrorist force"" posing a threat.

The COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic has overshadowed continued tensions between the U.S. and Iran in recent months, but the animosity between Washington and Tehran has resurfaced in recent days.

Last week, as many as 11 fast-attack IRGC ships encircled a group of U.S. warships in the Gulf. The U.S. Fifth Fleet said the move was ""unsafe and unprofessional,"" while the IRGC said the American ships were engaged in ""illegal, unprofessional, dangerous and even adventurist behavior"" in the area.

Then on Wednesday, Iran successfully launched a military satellite into orbit for the first time. The successful launch could have implications for the country's intercontinental ballistic missile program, which is one of the grievances that prompted Trump to withdraw from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action in 2018. Iran has denied that the satellite launch is connected to its ICBM program.

Hours after the launch, Trump said he had ordered military units in the Gulf region to respond aggressively to any perceived Iranian threat. ""I have instructed the United States Navy to if they harass our ships at sea,"" Trump tweeted.

The U.S. Navy was already permitted to fire on aggressors in self-defense, though Trump's tweet was interpreted as encouraging a more aggressive stance. The president clarified at a press conference later in the day that the military would not be changing its rules of engagement, telling reporters, ""We're covered, we're covered 100 percent.""

Deputy Secretary of Defense David Norquist told reporters: ""The president issued an important warning to the Iranians, what he was emphasizing is all of our ships retain the right of self-defense.""

Iran was quick to dismiss the threat. Iranian Mission to the United Nations spokesperson Alireza Miryousefi told Newsweek: ""In the midst of a global coronavirus pandemic when all attention worldwide is to combat this menace, the question is what the U.S. military is doing in Persian Gulf waters, 7000 miles from home.""

Parliamentary National Security Committee member Alaeddin Boroujerdi, meanwhile, told the Iranian Students' News Agency that Trump ""wants to divert public opinion from the internal crisis of the United States and the shortcomings in various fields."""

Ian Reynolds, 53, had worked as a paramedic for 32 years, and for the last eight had been working as a member of the Selhurst Park pitch-side medical team.

Crystal Palace Football Club paid tribute to him and said he was a “much-loved colleague” and friend.

Colleague Dr Amir Pakravan said: “As a person, he was the best friend you could wish for, always smiling, calm and easy-going and an avid Palace fan.

“As a colleague, he was extremely professional, reliable, approachable, highly experienced and knowledgeable, and always ready to help. He was the complete package and an absolute joy to work with.”

He is survived by his wife and two sons, one of whom, Jack, also works as a member of the Crystal Palace stretcher crew.

Dr Pakravan said: “Our pitch-side medical team will not be the same without Ian.

“The thoughts of everyone at Crystal Palace FC are with his family and friends.

Mr Reynolds had worked at New Addington, where he also served as an active Unison rep, as well the principal liaison between the London Ambulance Service and all the Croydon care homes.

A spokesperson for the union said he embodied all their values: “A wise, experienced and popular man who had time for everybody and could relate to his colleagues, members and patients alike – regardless of their background or identity – with an ease that endeared him to everyone he came across.

“He loved his music, consuming live gigs like he did craft ales. Ian was the mate who always had time for a curry and a chat, who knew what you were going through and would be there for you with wise words and irreverent jokes in equal measure.

“They don’t make them like Ian any more. He will be deeply missed by his union comrades, his Croydon ambulance family, his boys Jack and Ben (of whom he was immeasurably proud) and his wife Sian, who he loved with all his heart.”"

The global long fiber thermoplastics market size is expected to grow from USD 2.8billion in 2020 to USD 4.6 billion by 2025, at a CAGR of 10.5%, during the forecast period.Owing to anincrease in the demand for high-performance materials with properties, such as high strength-to-weight ratio, good tensile strength, and electrical conductivity, the global long fiber thermoplastics market is expected to witness significant growth during the forecast period.

PP resin comprises a major share of the long fiber thermoplastics market in terms of value and volume.

PP resin is a thermoplastic manufactured by combining propylene monomers. It is used in both consumer goods and industrial applications. Its unique properties and ability to adapt to various fabrication techniques make it a suitable material in a wide range of applications.

The injection molding process to account for the largest share in the global long fiber thermoplastics market during the forecast period in terms of value and volume.

Injection molding is a fast, high-volume, closed molding process that uses, most commonly, reinforced thermoplastics composites, such as nylon with chopped glass fiber. It is used for producing parts by injecting molten material into a mold. In this process, material for the part is fed into a heated barrel, mixed, and injected into a mold cavity. This process offers low-cost tooling, which is economical for low production volumes or for the production of large parts.

Glass fiber to have a significant market share in the global long fiber thermoplastics market during the forecast period.

Glass fiber is the most preferred and cost-effective reinforcement used for long fiber thermoplastics. Long glass fiber thermoplastic composites are manufactured through continuous filaments of fiber, which are melt-impregnated with thermoplastic polymer by the pultrusion process to create a high-performance bond. These are then cut into 1/2-inch (12 mm) composite pellets for convenient processing into net shapes via injection molding or extrusion processes. Glass fiber is commonly used as a reinforcing element in commercial and industrial composites.

The automotive end-use industry to account for the largest share in the global long fiber thermoplastics market during the forecast period in terms of value.

The strength-to-weight ratio of most of the long fiber thermoplastics is higher than that of steel and aluminum. The automotive industry needs to follow stringent regulations regarding fuel efficiency and weight reduction without compromising safety, performance, and processing efficiency. These requirements are fulfilled by the long fiber thermoplastics that provide material solutions for structural and semi-structural parts. They help in meeting requirements, such as weight reduction, structural performance, and maximum energy absorption. The manufacturing of cost-efficient parts and reliable mass production processes are enabled by the low processing cycle times of long fiber thermoplastics, which also increase their demand in the automotive industry.

Europe to account for the largest market share in the long fiber thermoplastics market during the forecast period.

Europe was the largest long fiber thermoplastics market, in terms of value, in 2019. The demand for these thermoplastics in automotive, electrical & electronics, and other industries is projected to improve due to product innovation and technological advances made in this sector. These factors drive the demand for long fiber thermoplastics during the forecast period.

Key players in the Long Fiber Thermoplastics (LFT) Market include Celanese Corporation (US), SABIC (Saudi Arabia), Lanxess AG (Germany), BASF SE (Germany), Mitsubishi Chemical Holdings (Japan), PlastiComp Inc. (US), Daicel Polymer Ltd. (Japan), Asahi Kasei Corporation (Japan), RTP Company Inc. (US), and Solvay (Belgium).. These companies are involved in adopting various inorganic and organic strategies to increase their foothold in the long fiber thermoplastics market.

The Rotary Club of San Antonio hopes to bring back its popular ice skating rink to Travis Park in November, during Fiesta, which was postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Last year, the organization opened its first ice rink the weekend after Thanksgiving. However, Brandon Logan, president of the Rotary Club of San Antonio, told mySA.com he anticipates the outdoor experience at Travis Park will begin in early November this year.

If plans for the project are approved, the ice rink will begin to operate during the Fiesta timeline (Nov. 5-15).

Although the intent is there, Logan said it's ""too early"" to know what the rules and regulations will be for November regarding public gatherings. During its two-month stint, the ice rink drew more than 20,000 skaters.

With the ever-changing uncertainties that come from the pandemic, Logan said that the club will comply with any orders local and state government officials may have for the fall.

""If our community project is approved, we will be more than ready to serve San Antonio in a meaningful and enjoyable way,"" Logan said."

These lowly little freshwater creatures could be what cleans it,The Potomac Riverkeeper Network wants to introduce millions of lamp mussels back into the river to help clean the waterway.,www.wusa9.com,"""The goal is to have 50 million mussels. This is just a start,"" said Potomac Riverkeeper Dean Naujoks.

WASHINGTON — Dramatic before-and-after photos showing how freshwater mussels cleaned a tank of badly polluted Potomac River water in a matter or hours are encouraging signs that water quality near Washington could be significantly improved if the animals are reintroduced into the river by the millions, according to the Potomac Riverkeeper Network.

The 2-year-old Lamp Mussels, a freshwater cousin of oysters, were recovered this week from a small demonstration project being conducted by the Potomac Riverkeeper Network at the National Harbor Marina in Prince George's County, Maryland.

Divers checking the mussel project under the docks found conditions so polluted and murky they were nearly blinded while trying to recover samples.

But in a little over an hour, the mussels brought to the surface significantly clarified an aquarium tank filled with dirty water that was placed on the dock.

The mussels are filter-feeders that sustain themselves by straining out algae and other pollutants as nutrition.

""The goal is to have 50 million mussels. This is just a start,"" said Potomac Riverkeeper Dean Naujoks.

""We started with 23 last year. The long term goal is to create a hatchery and start getting these mussels to start breeding on their own in the Potomac River and we start hopefully repopulating other parts of the river,"" he said.

Maryland is home to at least 17 species of freshwater mussels, according to the Maryland Department of Natural Resources.

But the native population near Washington has been badly decimated by pollution in the past half-century and is in need of restoration, according to Naujoks.

Biologists in several southeastern US states have been deeply concerned by mysterious die-offs of species in that region's rivers.

462,462,http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/2/9/367866/World/International/Australia-says-all-WHO-members-should-back-coronav.aspx,Australia says all WHO members should back coronavirus inquiry - International - World,,english.ahram.org.eg,"All member nations of the World Health Organization (WHO) should support a proposed independent review into the coronavirus pandemic, Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Thursday, further threatening strained ties with China.

Australia has become one of most forceful critics of Beijing for its handling of the spread of the coronavirus, with Morrison urging several world leaders to support an international inquiry into its origins and spread, as well as the WHO's response.

The COVID-19 outbreak originated in China and has since spread to infect some 2.3 million people globally and killed nearly 160,000, according to Reuters calculations. Beijing has fiercely rejected calls for an inquiry, describing the efforts as U.S.-led propaganda against China.

Morrison said all members of the WHO should be obliged to participate in a review, adding that Australia would push for the inquiry during the WHO Assembly on May 17.

""We'd like the world to be safer when it comes to viruses... I would hope that any other nation, be it China or anyone else, would share that objective,"" Morrison told reporters in Canberra.

China is Australia's largest trading partner, but diplomatic ties have frayed in recent years amid allegations Beijing has committed cyber-attacks and has attempted to interfere in Canberra’s domestic affairs.

""The so-called independent inquiry proposed by Australia is in reality political manipulation,"" said China's foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang, speaking at a daily news briefing in Beijing on Thursday. ...

""We advise Australia to give up its ideological prejudices,"" he said.

Australia's calls for an inquiry will win favour with the White House - which has been critical of China and the World Health Organization's handling of the pandemic, and has withdrawn U.S. funding from the U.N. agency.

China said on Thursday it will donate an additional $30 million to the WHO.

There also seems to be less enthusiasm for an inquiry in Europe, with both France and Britain saying now is not the time to apportion blame.

Germany's Angela Merkel said Thursday that the WHO is an ""indispensable partner"" and the country supports its mandate.

Morrison's comments came just hours after a senior Australian government official called on G20 nations to end wildlife wet markets over concerns they pose a threat to human health and agricultural markets.

The outbreak in China was thought to have started in a wet market in the city of Wuhan. Wet markets are a key facet of China’s daily life, though not all sell wildlife.

China imposed a temporary ban on selling wildlife on Jan. 23 and is now reviewing its legislation to restrict commercial wild animal trading on a permanent basis.

Minister for Agriculture David Littleproud said on Thursday he had asked government officials from the Group of 20 major economies to back a plan to end wildlife wet markets.

U.S. officials have also called for wildlife wet markets across Asia to be closed. Wet markets exist throughout Asia selling fresh vegetables, seafood and meat, with some also selling exotic animals.

Australia's call for global action comes as it successfully slows the spread of coronavirus, with new infections well below 1% a day. Australia has about 6,600 cases of coronavirus and 76 deaths from the virus.

Around a third of Australia's cases can be traced to cruise liners and one ship, the Ruby Princess owned by Carnival Corp , is responsible for about 10% of cases.

Authorities granted the Ruby Princess permission to disembark its 2,700 passengers last month without health checks, and police are how investigating whether the ship's operators knowingly let coronavirus patients disembark.

The Ruby Princess, which has been in Australia since March, is expected to depart on Thursday with just crew, though it is unclear where it will go."

While the US is planning to reach the apex in 13 days, the health experts estimate at least 2000 deaths to happen each day by mid-April. The US also is estimated to reach its peak in resource usage and many states may be needing more beds, ventilators by that time.

The White House estimate says that around 82000 people may die due to coronavirus by August this year, even with the social distancing. President Donald Trump said in his media briefing today that the US is going to have two painful and tough weeks ahead.

On the vaccine part, Donald Trump said the vaccine is likely to be available in the next four months, Dr. Fauci during his turn to speak, ruled it out saying that the vaccine may take a year or year and a half to come out, given its research. The vaccine is said to be developed by NSAID and Moderna, will not be using any part of virus-like other vaccines but is being built based on genetic information provided by China called mRNA-1273. The vaccine is now being called a messenger RNA Vaccine.

Today, there are 770 new cases of coronavirus in the US and the total deaths reached 3800. The total number of infected people in the US so far is 186,256. White House medical expert, Dr. Fauci opined that this virus may hit once again later this year. New York has recorded highest number of deaths in a day with 332 on Tuesday.

Meanwhile, upset with Trump’s inaccurate COVID briefings during media meets, more than 100,000 signed a petition demanding TV networks to stop airing Trump’s coronavirus live briefings. Trump’s briefings mostly had notes from health experts and later the health experts themselves coming up with factual details, and the president expressing his anger on journos and political opponents.

Italy is still not slowing down with more than 837 deaths on Tuesday coming to the total deaths of 12,428. Spain is also facing the same phase with 849 deaths today with a total of more that 8200 so far. France’s official death toll reached 3500 with 7500 new cases."

In the current times, the world market leader for man-made fiber systems for manufacturing polyester, polypropylene and nylon however believes itself to still be well positioned thanks to long-term strategic customer investments, simultaneously also exploiting numerous opportunities for change arising from the coronavirus pandemic.

The sales markets for man-made fiber systems and equipment have been primarily located in China, India and Turkey for many years now. Together, these markets — above all China — make up the lion’s share of the project landscape at Oerlikon Manmade Fibers. And this is paying positive dividends at the moment. Because the production facilities of the major manmade fiber manufacturers in China have been systematically fired up again over the past few weeks, with capacity utilization in-creasing consistently. New projects are being discussed.

Going against the flow

But why is it so? And why is the man-made fiber industry currently practically going against the flow of the rest of the textile machine industry? The reason is very simple: “Long before the coronavirus situation developed, the major man-made fiber manufacturers in China had decided to reverse-integrate their production chains to include petrochemicals in order to expand their portfolios with targeted investments, to reduce their dependence on a ‘single product’, to optimize their costs and ultimately to acquire greater control over margins in a global volume business,” explained Segment-CEO Georg Stausberg.

Similar processes and decisions — albeit not on the same scale as in China — have also been detected at the large man-made fiber manufacturers in India and Turkey. While China is already pursuing and implementing its “From Oil to Yarn” business model, the other market players are currently still focusing on the “From Melt to Yarn” concept. Even though businesses in India and Turkey are presently still temporarily severely impacted by the coronavirus situation, their long-term commitment cannot however be questioned, as the company-internally-agreed master plans will be systematically implemented moving forward.

All this has recently resulted in increased demand for spinning and texturing systems — just like those supplied by total solutions provider and world market leader Oerlikon Manmade Fibers with its Oerlikon Barmag, Oerlikon Neumag and Oerlikon Nonwoven product brands. “The investments in petrochemical systems are based on long-term strategic considerations and are resulting — even during the coronavirus pandemic — neither in short- and medium-term economic dips, nor in changed customer behavior.” Stausberg said. “For these reasons, we are currently continuing to look positively towards the future at Oerlikon Manmade Fibers. With orders on our books until 2023, we have created a very good cushion for ourselves. We have to thank all our customers, who have consistently placed their trust in us despite the challenging times we are currently in.

“We would also like to thank all our employees who remain highly-committed at their mobile workstations at home, servicing the markets throughout the world, providing customers with intensive online consultation on technology questions by means of video conference, continuing to manufacture our high-end technological products in superlative quality under the given coronavirus protection measures at our assembly and production sites worldwide and successfully assembling and commissioning the systems on-site, in part also remotely in collaboration with our clients’ staff,” stated Georg Stausberg with pride.

As a result of Oerlikon Manmade Fibers delving into the digital age years ago, the segment has experienced the intensive and short-term benefit from all the measures, in part also in its processing of customer projects. “Admittedly, the coronavirus situation has accelerated this digital transformation to an extreme extent. But it is working and the coronavirus crisis will also allow us to take many positive experiences we have made in our digitally-networked world with us moving forward,” Stausberg concluded."

Medhat Atalla died following treatment at Doncaster Royal Infirmary (DRI), where he worked as a consultant geriatrician, the hospital said on Thursday.

Dr Atalla moved to Britain from Egypt about 20 years ago and his colleagues said he cared for elderly people on three continents, including across the North of England.

In a statement, Doncaster and Bassetlaw Teaching Hospitals medical director Tim Noble and chief executive Richard Parker said: “It is with immense sadness that we inform you that our colleague, Dr Medhat Atalla, has passed away following treatment for Covid-19 at Doncaster Royal Infirmary.

“A hugely popular and respected colleague, Dr Atalla was a very special human being who practised medicine across three continents throughout his career, affecting the lives of so many in such a positive way.

“He was a truly gentle gentleman and he will be hugely missed by us all.”

The trust said Dr Atalla joined the hospital trust in 2014 and was a consultant geriatrician on DRI’s Gresley Unit.

The statement said: “We were fortunate to have worked with him for many years prior to this, since his arrival in the United Kingdom in the early 2000s, where he cared for many elderly patients in hospitals throughout the North of England.

“We would also like to take a moment to thank colleagues who cared for Medhat during his illness, and who did all they could to care for and support him as he bravely battled Covid-19.

“As a trust, we share our deepest sympathies with Dr Atalla’s brother and sister, and loved ones in Egypt, and we ask that the media respect their wishes during this extremely challenging time.”

Tributes poured in for Dr Atalla on social media.

One member of staff said on the trust’s Facebook page: “RIP you wonderful man.

“Your ward rounds were absolute gold, so much time spent listening to patients & giving them a reassuring squeeze when so many of us felt too rushed for time.

“You made them smile so much & your empathy did not go unnoticed. An enormous loss to geriatrics.”

Another said: “God bless him, he was a real NHS hero.

“I for one will never forget him. My heartfelt sympathy and condolences to his family and colleagues. I know everyone will be devastated.”

Dr Atalla is the second member of staff at DRI to die after contracting coronavirus, after plaster technician Kevin Smith."

Nearly a quarter of New York City’s 8.6 million residents could go hungry because of the coronavirus pandemic, Mayor Bill de Blasio said Thursday.

“I fear the number is going to be around 2 million New Yorkers who are food insecure as this crisis deepens and that’s a horrifying number,” de Blasio said at his daily City Hall briefing.

The projection is double the amount of New Yorkers who lacked reliable access to meals before the pandemic hit the city.

It is based on 500,000 people losing their jobs, including many breadwinners, de Blasio said.

“That means, of course, the ability to buy food is massively disrupted,” he said.

“Think about folks who just weeks ago couldn’t have imagined not having enough food to eat and now they’re struggling to find it. There’s so many people who need help,” de Blasio said.

City officials expect to give out 10 million free meals to hungry New Yorkers in April and an additional 15 million meals in May, de Blasio said.

Any city resident can get grab-and-go meals at Department of Education sites around the five boroughs. There’s also a free delivery service for homebound New Yorkers. The city and the state have pledged a total $50 million to help overwhelmed local food pantries.

The food pantry assistance is on top of the city’s $170 million emergency program to feed New Yorkers during the crisis.

“That’s going to have to grow so we need help from Washington to make all that happen,” de Blasio said, adding that the city expects reimbursement from FEMA for the emergency food program."

One such relationship that we saw flourish recently was that of TVF Founder Arunabh Kumar, whose company just gave a hit web series called Panchayat to the audience, and his girlfriend Shruti Ranjan. The couple who have been dating each other since 2013, recently announced their engagement, giving the newly coined phrase, 'love in the time of corona' a new meaning.

Arunabh and Shruti met seven years back when he had barely begun his TVF journey. Kumar and his teammates were shooting at a college and since he had extremely limited budgets for his videos, they would ask the people around to participate and that is how Shruti came into Arunabh's life.

The two fell in love and have been by each other's sides ever since.

Talking about their relationship, Arunabh says, ""We met at IIT Bombay where Shruti was pursuing her MSc in Environmental Science and it was not our love for acting that broke the ice but the discussions we had on Environmental Science and Meditation. She started dating me when I had no money, no work and no one knew me but she was always standing beside me. After, being diagnosed with partial blindness in my right eye because of depression, I actually started seeing things more clearly and what mattered to me the most. While I was racing against my treatment to create comic books and mentoring the team at TVF, we both decided to make our bond official. I am grateful to God and my teams at Indusverse & TVF that the completion of my comic books, success of my company's latest Show Panchayat and my engagement, all have come together.""

Adding further, Shruti Ranjan says, ""I remember that I went to meet him at his office back then and thought that it would be a proper work area instead of a bare storeroom like space. But it didn't bother me. I realized he was a struggling entrepreneur and it inspired me. I discovered my love for photography through him after I found a DSLR in his house. He introduced me to Tracy at his office and I began assisting her in Photography projects and found my calling. He has gone through a roller-coaster in his life but I have always believed in him and will continue to do so.""

At the moment, just like all of us, the happy couple is also dealing with the dregs of the coronavirus pandemic. The wedding is slated to happen later this year and the two are busy getting things ready for the same. Speaking on this, Arunabh says, ""It is a tough time for the entire human race right now. Everyone is going through this together. People are constantly motivating each other by staying positive and that is exactly what we are doing too. We are looking for the silver lining which is our upcoming wedding and spending our courtship period planning the special day.""

We wish this amazing couple happiness in abundance and may their relationship grow stronger every day.

Snelling National Cemetery in Minneapolis. Arrangements are with Peterson Brothers Funeral Home. www.petersonbrothers.com

Shirley Ann Durenberger, our sweet and spunky mom, grandma and great grandma surprised us on Saturday, April 18, 2020 and danced her way into heaven!! I truly believe she figured that at 90 years of age, enough was enough and made a deal with the Lord above. He graciously agreed and took her to her heavenly home. I'm sure my Dad, Jack, was excited to see her after being apart for the last 4 years.

I would love to share my beautiful mom with you. The first thing I think of when she comes to my mind is: love. My mom, who was a St. Paul girl her whole life (until she moved to Willmar in August of 2019), was extremely smart (a high school graduate), hysterically funny (she never realized she was), excelled as an accomplished seamstress (potholders were her specialty - if you did not get to own one of her potholders, you are missing out), knitted, crocheted and could iron a shirt like nobody's business (something I never could do as well as she). She had a green left thumb and grew the most beautiful flowers in her garden (peonies and lilies). Mom was always there to listen and ready to help a friend in need in any way she could. Most importantly, Mom LOVED her family. She adored her children, grandchildren and GREAT grandchild and couldn't wait to spend time with everyone - especially for our “themed” Christmas celebrations!

Sports were a huge part of her life. She was a life-long Twins fan and could hardly wait to see that first pitch of the season. No matter how bad they played, she would cheer them on. In the apartment where she lived, she had a little figurine of the Twins mascot that sat on a stand outside her door. If they won, the mascot would face forward, if they lost, that little figurine faced the wall!!! She also had a MN Gopher bobble head that she would do the same thing with. Everyone knew if the Twins or the Gophers won or lost by passing by to see if they were facing forward, or towards the wall!! She also cheered the Vikings on, always hoping they would one day win the Super Bowl!! My mom also enjoyed going to the casino. She would play the poker slot machine, using only nickels, for hours. Recently we made the trip to the casino and we had a wonderful time together!

Mom was married to my Dad for close to 60 years. They enjoyed life in St. Paul, living in a couple of different suburbs throughout the years. Never in my wildest of dreams did I ever think my mom would move to my town of Willmar! She made the decision to move last August. We found her a nice apartment that was only 8 minutes from my house. We saw each other almost every day and went on fun adventures throughout Willmar together! (Cub Foods, Robbins Island, Culver's and of course our home on the lake). One of her favorite things to do was ""see her new town"". She loved being here and we loved having her here.

Missing her more than we can say includes myself, Judy Treptau & my husband, Vic. Our son Zach and his wife Courtney, who live in Spicer and got to visit Grandma often. Our 2nd son, Josh and his wife Katie spent alot of time with Grandma when she lived in the city. They now live in Colorado. Our youngest son, Cody lives in Plymouth and got to spend an entire summer with Grandma in the cities a few years ago. Such priceless memories! In addition, we have family in the cities - my brother Greg Durenberger and his wife Karen who live in Lakeville, Greg's daughter, Laura Grunow & her husband Ahren and son Ethan, who would love to send Great Grandma custom paintings and drawings. Last, but not least, Greg's son Rick who lives in Apple Valley, who always enjoyed listening to her stories.

I can't end this memorial without sharing something I know my mom would want everyone to know, using her own words from the biography she recently wrote: ""Let it be known to all that in every situation, Shirley Ann Hislop Durenberger was guided on her journey and loved by Her God"".

I love you, Mom. And I miss you so much. Hug Dad for me."
470,470,https://marylandreporter.com/2020/04/23/md-chamber-of-commerce-ceo-stimulus-bill-is-critical-to-small-businesses/,Md. Chamber of Commerce CEO: Stimulus bill is 'critical' to small businesses,,marylandreporter.com,"Update: The House passed the stimulus bill on Thursday afternoon. It now heads to President Trump’s desk.

Maryland Chamber of Commerce President and CEO Christine Ross said the $484 billion stimulus package Congress is considering would provide “critical” support for small businesses that are suffering due to restrictions aimed at preventing the spread of the coronavirus.

The Senate approved the legislation on Tuesday. The House is expected to approve the legislation later this afternoon. President Donald Trump has said he supports the legislation. It provides $320 billion for small businesses, including $60 billion for small financial institutions. It also provides $18 billion for testing and $2.8 billion for the NIH and the CDC.

“We are grateful that congressional leaders and the administration were able to reach a deal to increase funding for SBA’s (Small Business Administration) PPP (Paycheck Protection Program)—this funding is critical for supporting small businesses during this time,” Ross told MarylandReporter.com in an email on Wednesday. “While we have learned that some Maryland businesses have received access to PPP funds from the first round, there are still many who were either left in the pipeline or have been unable to access the program.”

“These additional funds are necessary to support those Maryland businesses who have not yet been able to access support. In addition, we are urging Congress to turn its attention to necessary technical corrections to programs created in the CARES Act to ensure that all employers —especially small business owners — have access to financial support.”

Howard County Chamber of Commerce President and CEO Leonardo McClarty said the funding is “very significant, especially for businesses with 25 or few employers.” McClarty added: “Besides restaurants and retailers, that business group seems to be one that we hear from most frequently.”

McClarty was asked what business owners in the county are saying about the legislation.

“The biggest thing being mentioned is the need for funding and the desire to receive confirmation from both the SBA if applying from the EIDL [Economic Injury Disaster Loan] or their lender if applying for PPP. Most of the frustrations besides availability appear to be that businesses complete these loan packages and don’t receive feedback that packages are received and an anticipated wait time.

“There is a lot of anxiety right now and many feel left in limbo after they have submitted their applications. Sole proprietors are extremely frustrated. The UI process is difficult to figure out and comprehend and the fed loans i.e. PPP made them wait an entire week behind those with W-2’s. Moreover, the state programs left them out as well.”

“While there are a number of local businesses that have benefited from either EIDL or PPP loans, those who’ve applied and not been funded is a far greater number. For some it was a matter of the cue, for others it was waiting for their lender to be able to accept loan applications, and for many more it was simply the issue of insufficient funding levels to support the demand.”

“I think the general sense is relief that some movement is occurring, although that optimism is offset by the predictable level of partisanship that seems to weigh these things down in Congress. Another valid concern would be including legislative protections in whatever might pass to prevent using these “small business” rescue packages from being used to support large national chain restaurants like we saw in the last round.”

Today’s stimulus package is the third installment of money Congress has allocated in the past month to help states suffering from COVID-19. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has said that a fourth stimulus package is being considered and that it would address infrastructure concerns.

The Hogan administration is offering $175 million in loans and grants to help Maryland’s small businesses.

There are 15,737 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Maryland as of Thursday morning, according to the state’s Department of Health, while 680 people in Maryland have died from the virus."

In addition, Health CAS Mercy Mwangangi said six people have been discharged in the past 24 hours, bringing the total number of recoveries to 89.

The Ministry of Health said a total of 668 samples had been tested, out of which 478 were taken from Nairobi.

Of the new cases, 12 are from Mombasa which registered the highest single-day and five are from Nairobi and were picked by the ministry’s surveillance team.

However, Dr Mwangangi stated that Nairobi remains the county with the highest number of coronavirus cases in the country.

Two of the cases are from tests carried out at the designated quarantine centres.

The CAS said there is a worrying trend of Kenyans over-relying on hand sanitisers instead of washing hands with water and soap.

“We have noticed a worrying over-reliance on sanitizers while sanitizers are effective, soap and running water is the best for fighting this disease. People must, therefore, start prioritizing washing hands and only sanitize in conditions where sanitizing will be useful,” said Dr Mwangangi.

She said that contracting coronavirus is not a crime, as all of us have a potential risk of contracting the disease, adding that being quarantined was neither detention nor punishment for it was meant to serve the greater public good.

She noted that curfew and travel restrictions had yielded results in the fight against the pandemic and urged Kenyans not to stigmatise those in quarantine and those who have recovered from the virus.

“Quarantine facilities should not be looked at as prisons,” she warned.

She said different stakeholders are being engaged to help find a way to assist those unable to pay the bills needed to secure their release from quarantine facilities."

Shalala Admits Not Disclosing Stock Sales After Pelosi Appoints Her To Oversee Bailout Billions,"“Look, I knew what the law was. I missed the deadlines...""",www.zerohedge.com,"Rep. Donna Shalala has come out an openly admit that she did not report at least 6 stock sales that were made after she was elected to the house in 2018.

The sales only became a topic of discussion after Nancy Pelosi appointed Shalala to a committee conducting oversight on the hundreds of billions of dollars being provided to companies through the coronavirus relief bill, according to Axios.

Shalala sold stock in Boeing, Alaska Airlines, Chevron, Conoco, and AMC after she was elected to congress in 2018.

She claims she made the sales to avoid conflicts of interest, but she did not report them within 45 days as it required by the STOCK Act. “I did file my disclosure report, so everybody knew what my holdings are. They didn’t know I was unloading the entire portfolio so I could put everything into mutual [funds] basically to avoid any conflict of interest,” she said, according to The Hill.

Her spokesperson, Carlos Condarco, had previously said she was unfamiliar with the rules. “She had a misunderstanding about the periodic transaction report process and her need to report the sale of these stocks while preparing a blind trust. As a new member with a broker and attorney who were not familiar with the congressional disclosure rules, there was a misunderstanding.”

In terms of punishment, Shalala said she is open to whatever is deemed necessary: “Whatever they think is appropriate. Whether it’s a financial penalty or anything else. I’m really sorry I missed those deadlines in the process of trying to do the right thing.”

Recall, Kelly Loeffler and other lawmakers came under fire for selling stocks following a private congressional briefing on coronavirus, and shortly before the market crashed. Loeffler bought and sold roughly $1.4 million in stock.

""Ms. Loeffler reported that she and her husband bought about $590,000 of stock and sold about $845,000 of stock from Feb. 18 through March 13. If they had held the shares they sold through Monday, the stock would have been valued at $86,000 less than what they sold it for, according to the Journal analysis."" -WSJ (03/31/2020)"

A week earlier, before the government shut schools, pubs, clubs and many shops, few could have imagined how drastically life would change.

Four weeks on, the lockdown looks likely to continue for at least the next three weeks. The queues at the supermarkets will stay, our only interaction with friends and family living elsewhere will be by video call and no one will be able to sneak to the local for a pint after work.

At Great Western Hospital, 69 people who tested positive for the virus have lost their lives since the pandemic began, including A&E doctor Dr Edmond Adedeji. The numbers who have died in care homes is as yet unknown.Last night a further 15 cases had been confirmed, bringing the total number in Swindon to 299.

Across the county, crime has fallen by more than a quarter. 129 coronavirus fines have been handed out but, Wiltshire Police Chief Constable Kier Pritchard said, the lion’s share of the public are abiding by the rules.

At times of crisis we have seen the best of people, with scores walking out their front doors to applaud NHS workers every Thursday, people signing up to volunteer for the health service and youngsters drawing rainbows and hearts to show their support for those on the frontline.

Coun David Renard, leader of Swindon Borough Council, said: “Generally, Swindon residents have adapted well to the changes brought about by coronavirus and are following the government guidelines.

“We have seen many generous offers of help for those who need it and the community spirit which has arisen as a result is heart-warming. I hope that the really good things which we are witnessing, will continue as we come out of the lockdown and will make us a stronger community becoming more neighbourly into the bargain.”

The view over Swindon from Liddington Hill last night

More than 2,000 businesses have applied to Swindon Borough Council for an emergency grant, with £25m out of the £31m given to the council by Whitehall paid out to companies.

Before the lockdown began we spoke to landlord Jamie Stapleton, a co-owner of The Tuppenny in Old Town. He was preparing to launch a takeaway service – selling beers from the pub and to people’s doors.

Those plans were overtaken when Mr Johnson announced on March 20 that all pubs would shut. In the four weeks since then he’s still been selling to his regulars. “I never thought for a moment we’d be a web based courier for craft beer, but that’s what we’ve had to become. We were very quick off the mark to say we needed to adapt.

“We’re still selling the same product. We’re still seeing a lot of our regular faces and perhaps a lot of people who didn’t come into the bar often. It enables us to have a business to come back to.”

Police and Crime Commissioner Angus Macpherson pressed the importance of keeping to the restrictions. “As we continue through the next few weeks, I know we can count on the vast majority of people in our communities to carry on doing the right thing and only leaving their homes when essential to do so,” he said.

“We all have a role to play in the fight against this infection. We must all continue to adhere to the very latest advice from the government – this is about saving lives.”"

Jameela spoke to HL about the episode that she says changed her life!

In the midst of our quarantined state, Jameela Jamil has been keeping hope alive with the continuation of her I Weigh podcast episodes. Her April 24th episode will feature an interview with Billy Porter, and the Good Place actress dished on their in-depth discussions in an EXCLUSIVE interview with HollywoodLife.com! “He goes on a five minute shouting rant at me as a motivational speech. He motivates me. He screams motivation at me for about five minutes straight is the best thing I’ve ever heard,” Jameela revealed. “It changed my life honestly. I can’t get words out of my head.”

She continued, “I’m someone who really struggles to be motivated and he just kicked me in the ass in the middle of this podcast — it came out of nowhere.” The I Weigh host said that Billy went “absolutely everywhere” with her during their discussion, talking through his traumatic childhood to his experience as a gay black man in Hollywood. Jameela’s upcoming episodes will also feature conversations with Gloria Steinem, Roxanne Gay and Neal Brennan.

“It’s just anyone who can teach me,” she said of her podcast guests. “Everyone has a different, nuanced experience with mental health and with their journey to happiness. These people are coming onto this podcast really to teach me, and I’m sharing those conversations with the rest of the world. It’s anyone who will really go there with me and illuminate something about human nature.”

Jameela’s ability to humanize these celebrities and icons in a way society hasn’t seen them before has been incredibly helpful during this time of quarantine, especially for those who feel alone. “We’re sharing with everyone together for the sake of making other people feel more seen and heard and less alone in their experience,” she shared. “It’s just getting people to speak out and encourage each other to then tell their own truth.”

479,479,https://tribune.net.ph/index.php/2020/04/24/positively-classical-beyond-lockdown-times/,Positively classical beyond lockdown times | Lifestyle,,tribune.net.ph,"This Spotify playlist is in no way specially crafted to serve the duration of the Luzon-wide enhanced community quarantine. These are some of the albums that I have liked through the years, and in a way represents a little bit of my interest in music.

The pieces lean to the piano repertoire simply because it is what I listen to when at work. The instrument’s rhythm, particularly in the music of Johann Sebastian Bach, I noticed, goes well with my typing skills.

1. J. S. Bach’s Six Brandenburg Concertos

 

 These six concertos are essential in any collection because these pieces perfect the concerto format (three movements of fast-slow-fast) that was formulated by Arcangelo Corelli during the late Baroque period.

While there are many versions to choose from (Karajan, Marriner, Britten, Munchinger and Ristenpart), this almost forgotten version by English conductor Harry Newstone with the Hamburg Chamber Orchestra, I have found, is the most agreeable, a middle ground of historical performance and modern practice.

2. Emil Gilels plays Bach

 

 Emil Gilels was one of the first Russian virtuoso pianists to emerge from behind the Iron Curtain during the Cold War. The album collects mostly live performances of Bach, including the Siloti transcription of the Prelude in B minor, which was one of his favorite encore pieces.

3. Samuel Barber’s Knoxville: Summer of 1915

 

 The vocal cantata, quite popular during the Baroque and Romantic periods, was virtually out of fashion when Samuel Barber wrote this piece for soprano Eleanor Steber in 1947. Using a text by James Agee, it recalled a time that went with the Second World War, when life was slower and peaceful.

The version by Dawn Upshaw also comes with a riveting performance of the aria “No word from Tom — I go to him,” from Igor Stravinsky’s opera, The Rake’s Progress.

4. John Cage’s Dance Nos. 1-3

 

 When is a piano not a piano? When it is a prepared piano. John Cage took two of them and wrote these three pieces, which he called “dances.” If you love Chopin, you will be appalled by these pieces. The technique revolutionized the piano as a percussive instrument, capable of more than just mellifluous sounds.

The version by conductor Michael Tilson Thomas and pianist Ralph Grierson comes with the two-piano version of Stravinsky’s ‘The Rite of Spring’ and Steve Reich’s minimalist classic, ‘Four Organs.’

5. Franz Liszt’s Deux Legendes

 

 These are a pair of virtuoso piano solos on St. Francis of Assisi preaching to the birds and St. Francis of Paola walking on the waves. Franz Liszt has a lot of works for the piano, including transcriptions of entire symphonies and concertos and popular opera arias and lieder; these are great introductions to those pieces.

Look for the version by Wilhelm Kempff, a German pianist known more for Beethoven, Brahms and Mozart.

I was going to suggest the Piano Concerto No. 21, but the 23rd and 24th are a pair, the flow from one concert to the next almost seamless for almost an hour of soothing music.

 Sir Clifford Curzon’s versions with conductor Istvan Kertesz are classic ones.

This isn’t the first complete opera I listened to, but you can bet I was quite taken by the drama of this piece; it was like listening in to a live performance. This classic account from 1953, featuring the triumvirate of Maria Callas, Giuseppe di Stefano and Tito Gobbi, under the baton of Victor de Sabata, has remained a recommendation after more than half a century! And it’s in mono!

These exercises for beginner pianists were just that — exercises. They had been relegated to student recitals and encores until Russian virtuoso pianist Vladimir Horowitz resurrected them as concert-worthy pieces, opening many of his recitals with a handful of them.

Through the years, he managed to record an album’s worth of music that remain benchmarks of Scarlatti performances.

Sviatoslav Richter was the other Russian virtuoso to emerge from behind the Iron Curtain. What was unique about Richter was that he was choosy about the pieces he played and recorded. That’s why he has no complete collection of Beethoven piano concertos and sonatas, as well as pieces by Brahms and Mozart.

Luckily, he liked enough Schubert’s posthumously published final piano sonata to record it. It is the slowest version of the piece. But that stillness brings with it serenity, drama and profundity."

According to the ANSS communication officer, Dr Sakoba Keita was on advanced medical rest when he was tested for Covid-19.

“It happens that Dr Sakoba took advantage of this rest required by his doctor to do his test. The result of this test came out on Wednesday evening and was unfortunately positive,” Sory Keira told the African Press Agency (APA).

Dr Sakoba Keita, an epidemiologist by training had previously led the fight against cholera and Ebola in Guinea.

Since the appearance of Covid-19, he has been at the front, coordinating the national response against the disease.

Meanwhile the Minister of Youth, Mouctar Diallo has also been declared positive for Covid-19.

This was confirmed by his New Democratic Forces (NPD) party on its Facebook page.

Diallo is the fourth member of the Guinean government to contract coronavirus, after Public Works Minister, Moustapha Naité and Security Minister Albert Damantang Camara, who have recovered, unlike Sékou Kourouma, the minister-secretary general of the government who died of the disease on April 18."

Click here to read the full article.

Vermont singer-songwriter Henry Jamison has teamed with Grizzly Bear’s Ed Droste for a new song, “Green Room.” The track will appear on Jamison’s upcoming Tourism EP, out May 15th via Color Study.

“Green Room” boasts a wistful folk-rock sway and finds Jamison recounting a moment of existential woe in the titular backstage area before a concert. With Droste providing back-up vocals, the pair sing together, “And the monster here, he’s only half of me/ Alligator tears in my cup of tea/And the rain falls now through the hemlock tree/There’s a ghost in me.”

In a statement, Jamison spoke about the origins of the “green room,” noting it earned its name in part because of “how nervous people get before playing,” and also because “Greek actors dedicated their performances to Dionysus, god of Greenery.” For Jamison, the space has been both a sublime and scary one, and he recalled the moment that inspired his song.

“The song is specifically about being in L.A. and seeing the movie Spirited Away come on the TV while I half-slept on the green room couch,” he said. “It was my then-ex-girlfriend’s favorite movie and brought on a flood of memories. It also features a very compelling character called ‘No-Face,’ a being who is so spiritually empty that it needs to devour everything in its sight, a mythical ‘hungry ghost.’ Being in L.A., home to many would-be stars, I was forced to ask if I was a hungry ghost myself, as my career had taken me away from so many things I missed so badly.”

As for working with Droste on the song, Jamison said: “Grizzly Bear has been my favorite band for about 10 years, so I was extremely happy about it. And it’s the first song I’ve had with long melodic lines, which fits his slightly operatic style especially well. My favorite part of the song is when he sings ‘monster.'”

Droste is one of five vocalists that will appear alongside Jamison on the Tourism EP. The others are Fenne Lily, Darlingside, Joseph and Lady Lamb.

Three Mumbai residents, including two sadhus, who were on their way to Silvassa on April 16, were lynched by a mob in Gadakchinchale village of Palghar district on the suspicion that they were thieves. Nagpur Police Commissioner B K Upadhyaya said they received a complaint which was turned into an FIR at Sadar police station.

DCP Vinita Sahu said Goswami has been booked under sections 117 (abetting commission of offence by the public or by more than 10 persons), 120 (B) (criminal conspiracy), 153 (A) (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony), 153 (B) (imputations, assertions prejudicial to national-integration), 295 (A) (deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs), 290-A (public nuisance in cases not otherwise provided for), 500 (defamation), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace), and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the ipc. Another FIR was filed against him in Raipur, Chhattisgarh.

In a statement condemning Goswami, Maharashtra Congress said the killing has been wrongly given a communal angle despite ample proof of the contrary. ""At a time when country is fighting against coronavirus pandemic, it is very unfortunate that a section of media as well as politicians are trying to create social unrest... [and] spread racial and religious hatred in society. Goswami has tried to create misogyny against women in the society. He made an outrageous remark against the Congress president on a live TV programme. This is completely unethical journalism and we publicly protest it. We believe in brotherhood and cannot accept such animosity. This will be dangerous for the unity and integrity of the country (sic),"" it said."
485,485,https://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/phoenix-children-s-makes-rapid-telehealth-shift-amid-covid-19,Phoenix Children’s makes rapid telehealth shift amid COVID-19,Adapting the Zoom platform and the quick development of a dashboard enabled the organization to shift two-thirds of outpatient visits to the new platform.,www.healthcareitnews.com,"Protecting pediatric patients, their families and hospital staff required a radical and rapid shift in care delivery strategies for Phoenix Children’s Hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The organization took a fast-track approach to shift its ambulatory-patient encounters to virtual ones, moving away from in-person visits that had been the staple of Arizona’s only freestanding children’s hospital.

Spurred by the urgency of the COVID-19 crisis, the healthcare organization made the shift to telehealth within a week, transitioning most of its 6,000 weekly appointments to a telemedicine platform.

The quick transition was in large part supported by a custom-made, in-house-developed analytics dashboard that helped coordinate the efforts of the clinicians, clinic managers and scheduling staff, while it provided a single view of the entire operation to senior leadership.

Using the dashboard, clinicians are able to carefully triage upcoming appointments to select patients who are appropriate for telemedicine visits versus those who should be seen in person, such as patients who need to come in for chemotherapy infusions.

The movement toward virtual visits aims to protect patients, their families and healthcare workers from exposure to COVID-19, thus making it essential to eliminate as much in-person patient traffic as possible at the hospital and its clinics.

The telehealth initiative drew wide support from clinicians as well as patients, said Dr. Vinay Vaidya, Chief Medical Information Officer at the facility, which has 433 licensed beds.

The biggest hurdle was not so much in rapidly converting in-person visits to telemedicine visits or winning clinicians over to the idea, Vaidya said. Clinicians at the facility typically were quick to adopt new technologies and embraced change that improved patient care.

“The bigger challenge was the operational task of selecting the appropriate patients for telemedicine visits, communicating this change to the scheduling staff, contacting families and keeping track of the entire process for more than 6,000 patients each week, seen by more than 300 providers in more than 35 different pediatric subspecialties,” he said.

While a few clinicians at Phoenix Children’s had interacted with patients via consumer apps, the facility had no formal telemedicine platform as of mid-March. Many of the facility’s physicians already were familiar with Zoom, having used it mainly for meetings, and in some cases for telemedicine. In short order, Zoom became the core platform upon which the organization’s IT department was able to customize the basic offering, and integrate the dashboard functionality using Microsoft’s Power BI to build out its virtual-care capabilities.

The dashboard serves multiple audiences. For clinicians, it enables them to see their next appointments and whether encounters will be via the telehealth platform, simply by telephone or in person. They also can see the appointment time, approximate length of the visit, and a short explanation of the diagnosis and of the reason for the visit.

Use of the telehealth platform has been a boon to efficiency in other ways. For example, it enables multiple clinicians involved in a complex patient’s care to interact with the patient and adult caregiver at the same, thus helping with information transfer and collaboration, Vaidya noted.

The dashboard reaches into the hospital’s clinical systems via an application programming interface to supply real-time data on patient visits for executives and schedulers. It can provide organization-wide as well as department-specific information – for example, enabling schedulers to see which specific patients can be shuffled from an in-person visit to a virtual encounter.

The dashboard also is able to drill down to actionable items, such as providing a daily call list for each of the facility’s more than 100 schedulers, and it can auto-text families when schedulers can’t reach them by phone.

The shift to virtual care was quick. For the week of March 8, all 6,670 ambulatory clinic visits were carried out as in-person visits. Just a few weeks later, more than two-thirds of the visits were successfully conducted using the telemedicine platform. And some departments were even able to convert as many as 80% to 90% of their visits to telemedicine, Vaidya said.

“We have been using data [to direct operations] for a long time,” he added. “We have various dashboards that drive clinical, operational and financial outcomes. We expect to really optimize this platform and continue to offer it to patients and their families.”

Work on second-generation Mac chips has already begun, based on the 2021 iPhone processor.",bgr.com,"
• Apple will release its first ARM-based Mac with an in-house processor in 2021, Bloomberg reports.
• Apple’s first Mac chips will feature 8 high-performance cores and at least 4 energy-efficient cores.
• Work on second-generation Mac chips has already begun, based on the 2021 iPhone processor.

Rumors of Apple ditching Intel and designing its own processors for the Mac have been floating around for years, but a new report says the company will finally take the leap in 2021. According to Bloomberg, Apple plans to start selling computers with systems-on-a-chip designed in-house next year, barring any setbacks.

Bloomberg’s report says that Apple is working on three ARM-based Mac processors through an initiative codenamed Kalamata. The chips are said to be based on the A14 processor that will power the next iPhone, but sources say that the first of the three chips will be “much faster” than those found in iPhone and iPad models.

As the report explains, the latest mobile device chips designed by Apple have multiple processing units (also called cores) which handle a variety of tasks for the phone or tablet. For example, the newest iPad Pro has four cores “for performance-intensive workloads” and four cores “to handle low-power tasks to preserve battery life.” The first Mac processors, meanwhile, will have eight high-performance cores (Firestorm) and at least four energy-efficient cores (Icestorm). Apple is reportedly considering including more than 12 cores in the future as well.

Not only will designing its own computer processors allow Apple to reduce its reliance on Intel — it will also allow Apple to have more control over the performance of the Mac and MacBook lines. Apple’s chips are said to double or even quadruple the number of cores in Intel’s chips in some upcoming Macs, such as the MacBook Air, which has just two cores. Making its own chips will also make it easier for Apple to “unify its apps ecosystem.”

Even with this new unification, Macs will continue to run on macOS. There has been speculation and some demand for Macs to adopt iOS, but Apple has resisted. Bloomberg says that Apple is working on tools that will help to ensure any apps developed for Intel-based Macs still work on the ARM-based Macs as well.

While it might be at least another year before we see the first ARM-based Mac on the market, sources told Bloomberg that Apple built a Mac chip based on the iPad Pro’s A12X for internal testing back in 2018. This gave the company the confidence it needed to move on from Intel altogether in the years to come. Now, Apple is reportedly already working on the second generation of Mac processors, which will be based on the architecture of the chip that will power the 2021 iPhone, putting all of Apple’s major hardware on the same processor development cycle."

China's Natural Resources Ministry and Civil Affairs Ministry published a joint release on Sunday which announced the Chinese names and coordinates belonging to 25 islands, shoals, and reefs, as well as 55 submerged oceanic mountains and ridges, all in the contested waterway south of the mainland, reported AFP.

""No state can claim sovereignty over underwater features unless they are within 12 nautical miles of land. So is China ignorant of this or deliberately trying to overturn international law?"" Bill Hayton, an associate fellow at British think tank Chatham House, told the outlet.

""China has ratified the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) which is very clear on what states can and cannot claim as territory. Yet China seems to be going against UNCLOS by asserting sovereignty in very far away places.""

Despite China's individual claims in the South China Sea, it has also made the more general claim to roughly 90% of the waterway via the so-called ""nine-dash line,"" which has never been precisely delineated. In addition to China, several other countries have also laid claim to parts of the South China Sea, including Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei, Taiwan, and the Philippines. The waterway is believed to contain huge hydrocarbon deposits beneath the seafloor and carries trillions in annual sea trade.

Yan Yan, director of the Research Center of Oceans Law and Policy in the National Institute for South China Sea Studies, told the South China Morning Post that China's territorial claims were a showing of its sovereignty in the region.

He noted that this is not the first time such an announcement has been made by China. The last one came during a 1983 exercise in which China laid claim to 287 features in the South China Sea.

""China is faced with an increasingly aggressive Vietnam as the country continues to fish illegally and conduct oil and gas exploration unilaterally in the South China Sea,"" Yan said. ""And as this year's chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, Vietnam should exercise more restraint rather than acting aggressively.""

Last month, Vietnam issued a diplomatic note to the United Nations which protested China's sovereignty claims in the South China Sea.

Beijing has stepped up activity in the South China Sea over the past six years and on Saturday announced that two new districts will govern areas in the sea that overlap with claims from Vietnam and Taiwan.

""The State Council has recently approved the establishment of the Xisha and Nansha districts under Sansha city,"" the Ministry of Civil Affairs stated, using the respective Chinese names for the Paracel and Spratly Islands.

Vietnam has since responded, stating that China's actions ""seriously violated"" its territorial sovereignty, according to AFP. China's Foreign Affairs Ministry fired back on Tuesday, contending that the Spratly and Paracel Islands are China's ""innate territories"" and that Vietnam's claims in the South China Sea are ""illegal."""

Witness the SECURE Act of 2019, “Setting Every Community Up of Retirement Enhancement Act.” With 29 provisions, the text",www.thecrier.net,"Congressional bill writers love acronyms, which make obtuse legalese sound sexy. Witness the SECURE Act of 2019, “Setting Every Community Up of Retirement Enhancement Act.” With 29 provisions, the text is more “ponderous” than “sexy.” With SECURE Act changes, many of you should review, potentially revise, your retirement plans. While consulting your advisor is recommended, in this brief column we highlight some of the more impactful provisions for individuals.

A key change is the age when Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) for Qualified IRAs begin, moving from age 70 ½ to 72. The change doesn’t apply to those already 70 ½ or older by 12/31/2019. Also, the IRS proposes updating life expectancy tables by 2021, which will change the calculation of your yearly RMD amount.

Congress was concerned about increasing life expectancies and data indicating Americans were not saving enough toward financial independence. Per a 2018 Northwestern Mutual Life survey, 20 percent of Americans have no retirement savings at all, while a third of those nearing retirement have saved less than $25,000. This advisor recommends $1 to $1.5 million in today’s dollars as a minimum target. Of a $1 million nest egg, if you withdraw money at a 5 percent annual rate to run your life, that’s $50,000, $4,167 per month gross, or $3,334 at an average tax bracket of 20 percent; $3,542 at 15 percent. To this number add Social Security, net of deductions for taxes and Medicare insurance premiums. How does that square with your envisioned lifestyle, family and survivor needs, health status, longevity assumptions? You could get by on less but is “less” a good planning objective?

One change benefits those who work past age 70 ½. Previously, a person older than 70 ½ could not contribute to a traditional IRA. Now you may contribute to an IRA at any age if you have earned compensation. But, illustrating the adage that “the government giveth and the government taketh away,” lifetime stretch IRAs are gone, with a few exceptions. Once a viable strategy for adding to retirement security for non-spousal beneficiaries like children or grandchildren, the Act requires inherited IRA and defined contribution account assets to be withdrawn within 10 years and taxes paid.

Exceptions include a spouse, disabled or chronically ill persons (with strict criteria), and persons not more than 10 years younger than the IRA owner, generally siblings around the same age. A child of the deceased (but not grandchildren) who hasn’t reached the age of majority will be able to stretch until the age of majority, with the remainder then subject to a 10-year distribution. Tax-planning will be important. Does one take it out each year for 10 years, in select years, or all at once in year 10? That depends on growth assumptions and assumed yearly tax brackets going forward. Situations where IRA monies are directed to a trust may need legal review so as to not conflict with the 10-year distribution rule.

Jamie Hopkins, finance professor at Omaha’s Creighton University, writing in the February, 2020, Journal of Financial Planning, reinforces the idea of using life insurance as a “tax-advantaged way to pass legacy.” Says he, “It might make sense for many individuals to purchase life insurance as the primary legacy tool or to use life insurance death benefits, which can be received income- and estate-tax free, to offset the higher taxes associated with a 10-year distribution period.”

Higher tax-bracket individuals generally will want to delay IRA withdrawals until at least 72, and then take only the RMD, no more. Using life insurance cash value loans to provide tax-fee cash flow prior to age 72 and as a supplement thereafter, could make sense. If you have cash value life insurance policies in force they should be reviewed as to current performance, viability given current objectives, and strategies related to SECURE Act changes.

The Act allows penalty-free withdrawals up to $5,000 from retirement plans for the birth or adoption of a child, and penalty-free withdrawals up to $10,000 from 529 education savings plans for repayment of certain student loans. Are these withdrawals wise? It depends on your long-term objectives, alternative uses of capital, and the long-term impact of money no longer in an account to grow and compound.

The SECURE Act allows the inclusion of annuities in 401(k) plans, and insurance companies are gearing up to provide products. Annuities are complex contacts that must be understood relative to your personal circumstances and big picture. Many firms provide participants with a list of plan investment options to choose from with little or no guidance. Work with a trusted advisor who can integrate all aspects of a retirement savings plan into a cohesive strategy.

True retirement security and financial independence is up to you. The SECURE Act merely adds choices, new rules, and complexity.

495,495,https://www.fool.ca/2020/04/23/should-you-dump-your-bank-stocks-before-they-release-earnings/,Should You Dump Your Bank Stocks Before They Release Earnings?,Royal Bank of Canada (TSX:RY)(NYSE:RY) is a cheap buy today -- but will it go even lower after the bank stock releases its earnings?,www.fool.ca,"The Motley Fool Canada » Bank Stocks » Should You Dump Your Bank Stocks Before They Release Earnings?

Earnings season has begun, which means there’s going to be a whole lot of bad news coming out in the weeks to come. Companies will be slashing forecasts and announcing cost-reduction strategies in order to combat the impact that the coronavirus pandemic will have on their financials.

Even investors who hold banks stocks may want to consider whether they should hang on to their shares before the banks release their earnings or not, as they could be headed even further down.

Big U.S. banks already down after disappointing earnings results

Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase & Co both released their earnings last week, and both stocks were down more than 10% within just a few days of reporting their results. Concerns of defaults and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon saying there’s a “likelihood of a fairly severe recession” on the way likely sent investors into a bit of a panic.

And the reality is that when the big Canadian bank stocks release their earnings next month, they may not have much better news to report.

A gloomy outlook for the future could lead a top bank stock like Royal Bank of Canada (TSX:RY)(NYSE:RY) back to the 52-week low it reached in March when the markets were crashing. And that’s why for investors who are holding bank stocks, it may be worth considering selling your shares before that news comes out.

However, if you’ve held on to your shares for years and a 10% or 20% drop in price won’t put a big dent in your overall investment, then you’re likely better off hanging on.

Shares of RBC and other bank stocks will recover over time. They recovered after the financial crisis more than a decade ago and they’re safe bets to recover from the coronavirus pandemic as well.

But much more of a decline isn’t all that likely

While bank stocks may fall after they release their earnings, investors shouldn’t get too greedy and expect that they might fall much further than where they already are today. Here’s how investors have valued RBC stock over the past 12 years, based on its price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple:

Even during the 2009 downturn, RBC’s P/E didn’t fall as low as it did these past few weeks. And so while banks stocks may suffer declines when they go to report their earnings, they likely won’t be drastic enough that it makes sense for investors to wait.

The danger is that by waiting for more of a decline to come, investors may risk missing out on stocks that are already bargain buys today.

RBC’s stock may suffer some losses in the near future but history says that it’s likely the stock is not only a good buy at today’s prices, but that it will recover as well.

Its dividend is currently yielding around 5% per year which is a very good payout for the top bank stock. Even if it stops increasing its payouts amid a recession, you’ll be hard-pressed to find a much higher and safer yield than RBC."

Two women and a dog were killed in Potrero Hill on Tuesday night, after their Nissan SUV went through a T intersection and over a cliff. A man who was also inside the vehicle is hospitalized.

The incident occurred around 7:20 p.m. at the intersection of 25th and Dakota streets (pictured above), where a stop sign faces a hurricane fence at the top of a precipitous drop.

Police say the vehicle drove across the intersection and through the fencing. After falling down the cliff, it landed in a parking lot used for commuter buses, according to images of the aftermath.

The SUV's driver, 28-year-old San Francisco resident Angelique Starks, was ejected from the vehicle and declared dead at the scene, along with the dog. A female passenger, whose identity has not been shared with press, was also ejected, and died after being transported to the hospital.

The male passenger, who remained in the vehicle as it fell, is hospitalized in non-life-threatening condition.

The cause of the collision remains under investigation.

In normal times, many of us regularly visit national parks, wildlife refuges and other recreational sites spread out across more than 500",www.dailystarjournal.com,"America’s public lands belong to the American people. In normal times, many of us regularly visit national parks, wildlife refuges and other recreational sites spread out across more than 500 million acres of land managed by the Department of the Interior.

But these are certainly not normal times.

President Trump has led and coordinated an “All-of-America” strategy to combat the coronavirus pandemic and slow the spread of the virus.

The Department of the Interior, as the primary public lands manager in the United States, has accordingly done its part to protect the health and safety of the public and our employees.

From the advent of this pandemic, the National Park Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Bureau of Land Management and other bureaus have taken measures to try to maintain basic accessibility to our lands, while adhering to guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as well as state and local public health authorities.

Our response to this public health crisis has been led by our incredible public health officials on staff and those of state and local jurisdictions.

We have implemented our pandemic plan in conducting risk assessments of our public lands and facilities and relied on the guidance of public health officials in modifying or even closing access to some of our country’s most iconic places such as Yellowstone National Park, Grand Canyon National Park and the Washington Monument.

Closure is a last but sometimes necessary resort to best protect the public during this pandemic. By working in close coordination with public health experts and with the cooperation of the public in following social distancing, we have been able to keep most of our public lands open.

Based on the guidance of public health officials, we have made, and will continue to make, necessary changes to our operations that attempt to keep America’s public lands accessible during this pandemic, allowing the public to have a place to be socially distant together.

Our public lands, urban parks and national memorials can serve as places of solace, respite and even healing in times of challenge. These places have played that role in my own life, as I know they have for millions of other Americans.

Due to changes in our operations and offerings to the American people in only providing the most basic services, I directed all of our public lands units in March to waive entrance fees. This action is a recognition that we are not providing a full-service experience and an important means to limit contact between visitors and our employees at the entrances of our different locations.

To be able to continue to maintain the accessibility of public lands, it is the responsibility of all of us who visit to do our part and follow CDC and local public health guidance.

It is vital that visitors social distance; if an area is crowded, visit another time; pack out what you pack in; maintain at least 6 feet of social distance from others; and be prepared for limited access to facilities and restrooms.

We must do what we can to ensure that we are helping to slow the spread of this coronavirus and not negatively impacting small and rural communities adjacent to public lands."
498,498,https://mynorthwest.com/1831693/sources-guaido-allies-take-slice-of-first-venezuela-budget/,Sources: Guaido allies take slice of first Venezuela budget,"MIAMI (AP) -- Opposition lawmakers in Venezuela quietly agreed to pay themselves $5,000 a month when they readied special $100 bonuses for doctors and",mynorthwest.com,"MIAMI (AP) — Opposition lawmakers in Venezuela quietly agreed to pay themselves $5,000 a month when they readied special $100 bonuses for doctors and nurses battling the coronavirus — a large payout for a nation where most workers are scraping by on couple of dollars a month, according to people involved in the process.

Funding for the payout, which has not been previously reported, was contained in legislation passed last week by the National Assembly setting up an $80 million “Liberation Fund” made up of Venezuelan assets seized by the Trump administration as part of its sanctions campaign to remove socialist leader Nicolás Maduro.

The legislation was touted as a hallmark achievement for Juan Guaidó, the 36-year-old congressional leader recognized as Venezuela’s rightful president by the U.S. and nearly 60 other nations, but who has struggled to exert real power. For this first time since invoking the constitution to proclaim himself as acting president, he would have access to some of the billions of dollars in Venezuelan assets frozen abroad.

The details have been shrouded in secrecy, however. The text of the new measure, which implements a general law passed in February creating the fund, hasn’t been made published in the official legislative gazette as required although The Associated Press obtained a copy from sources. And the official announcement makes no mention of salaries or the proposed $5,000 payout, saying only that 17% of the $80 million in recovered assets will be set aside for “the defense and strengthening of the national legislative power and the social protection of its members.”

Guaido’s communications team issued a statement late Thursday denying a $5,000 “salary” had been approved. It said lawmakers, who have gone unpaid since Maduro cut off funding to the legislature after it fell to the opposition in 2015, will determine an appropriate amount and communicate it to the rest of the country in a transparent manner. It said the $14 million in funding earmarked for the National Assembly would pay not not only lawmakers’ personal income but also cover office expenses, staff costs, travel and other related legislative expenses.

Two lawmakers and three Guaidó aides earlier confirmed the plan and acknowledged that the optics looked potentially bad coming as many Venezuelans struggle to cope with an economic crisis that has reduced the minimum wage to barely $2 a month. The five agreed to discuss the matter only if granted anonymity, worrying they might face retribution for airing details of what they described as a fierce, months-long debate that threatened to split the anti-Maduro coalition.

They point out that spread out over the full five-year legislative session, the payments amount to $1,000 a month — far less than what lawmakers earn elsewhere in Latin America. They said some lawmakers will surely refuse to collect the money, even though many struggle to make ends meet while living in exile or traveling to Caracas for parliamentary debates

Since the legislation passed, Guaidó has frequently promoted his plan to hand out $100 bonuses to an estimated 60,000 doctors and nurses fighting the coronavirus pandemic in a country where most hospitals lack running water, electricity and basic supplies.

“The dictatorship has billions of our dollars sequestered but we, with less than 0.01% of what they have, can do a lot more,” Guaidó said while announcing his plan.

The $14 million in funding for the National Assembly is the second largest item in the “Special Law for the Venezuelan Liberation Fund and Attention to Vital Risks,” after a 45% outlay on social spending to ease the humanitarian crisis. That includes the three monthly bonuses of $100 each for “health care heroes,” payment of which will be made via digital wallets. The system will be managed with the Organization of American States at a cost of $9.2 million.

An additional 11% is earmarked for diplomatic envoys in the countries that recognize Guaidó as interim president. There is also money to strengthen the opposition’s communications outreach, judicial cooperation and $4.5 million for “security and defense of democracy” to be used at Guaido’s discretion.

The money comes from some of the billions in frozen Venezuelan assets abroad, much of it proceeds from oil sales and the earnings of Houston-based CITGO, a subsidiary of state oil giant PDVSA, that the Trump administration took away from Maduro but until now had refused to hand over to Guaidó.

Francisco Rodriguez, a Venezuelan economist who used to work in the National Assembly, said he welcomes good pay for elected officials working in the public’s interest. But he said the opposition and the U.S.´ efforts would be better spent assisting Venezuelans devastated by the country’s collapse, including the estimated 5 million migrants who have fled their homes in recent years and have no savings to fall back on amid the pandemic.

“It’s deeply disturbing that legislators would be willing to approve a generous compensation package for themselves without having yet found the time to discuss how they can use the funds at their disposal to help Venezuelans now living on the verge of starvation,” said Rodriguez.

Led by Guaidó, opposition lawmakers have faced repeated physical attacks, threats and arrests by Maduro’s security forces. Since January, they have been blocked from even entering the federal legislative palace after a dissident faction of lawmakers — whom the opposition alleges were bribed by Maduro — claimed leadership of the congress with the support of the ruling party.

Seeking to root out corruption and avoid future defections from Guaido’s slim majority, opposition leaders considered it important to start paying an honest wage, according to the five people. Payments, which are retroactive to January, will also be made to substitute lawmakers, who often fill in for the large number of elected representatives forced into exile.

Members of Maduro’s party will not receive any payments. That is because many have been sanctioned in the U.S. for trampling on Venezuela’s democracy.

The Trump administration must still issue a special license giving a five-member commission appointed by Guaidó access to the funds, which are sitting in an account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York after the U.S. government seized a $342 million payout from a gold-for-loans deal in 2015 that Maduro defaulted on with the Bank of England.

To these ears, the station’s content rivals that of pay-radio SiriusXM’s Siriusly Sinatra channel, but as with all internet radio streams, both live and on-demand, the price of admission to The Great American Songbook is free.

How to tune in to internet radio

If you know a station’s call letters or name, it’s a snap to haul in a specific internet radio station on a computer or smart device—just type it in or speak to a smart speaker like an Amazon Echo, Google Home, or Apple HomePod.

For deep-sea fishing in the great unknown, though, it pays to go through a radio station aggregator: An online database of curated links to radio stations searchable by location, genre, popularity, and—sometimes—stream quality.

First among many, and first in my heart, is TuneIn Radio, the 800-pound gorilla of internet radio station aggregators. TuneIn Radio comes pre-installed or is loadable on more than 200 connected devices, including smart speakers from the likes of Sonos and Bose, smart TVs, streaming media players (e.g., Roku and Amazon Fire TV), smartphones, tablets, gaming consoles (Xbox and PlayStation), and personal computers.

With a global database of more than 100,000 stations in 197 countries and 22 languages, plus 5.7 million podcasts and on-demand show offerings, TuneIn comes closest to world radio completeness (and domination). Senior director of marketing Ana Guillen tells me it is now attracting 75 million listeners a month and has witnessed an especially strong 53-percent uptick in news content listenership as the COVID-19 pandemic has escalated.

The most notable gap in TuneIn’s channel library are the 853 commercial stations in 153 U.S. markets owned by iHeartMedia (formerly Clear Channel Communications). To access those, you need to tap into the iHeartRadio app and portal, likewise accessible for free on internet radios, smartphones, tablets, computers, and similar connected devices. Aiming to become a one-stop destination (and sell more advertising), iHeartRadio also serves up mass appeal playlists and personalized music stations (a la Pandora); has distribution deals with commercial radio chains in Canada, Australia, and New Zealand; and also links listeners to some non-aligned stations. But the service doesn’t have nearly the global reach or stylistic diversity of TuneIn or other hard-striving streaming radio promoters.

Veteran internet radio aggregator VTuner does have a database that rivals TuneIn. About 30 staffers toil in the Philippines to keep its inventory of station formats, URLs, and streaming codecs up to date. Literally hundreds of world stations presenting in a particular category are accessible with a single tap on VTuner’s barebones, but functional website. I also appreciate that this app lets a user search through its inventory by the sonic quality of signal (more on that momentarily). The VTuner platform powers several lines of smart speakers and A/V receivers, though in recent years it has lost significant market share to Airable, a rival based in Germany.

Want to be led by the hand to “the most popular” local stations in a music, information or sports radio category? The on-screen guide for MediaU (also based in Germany) offers user-friendly graphics and a sophisticated batch of Euro-centric picks. What’s #1 on their Country station roundup? Prague-based Country Radio, featuring Czech-language singing cowboys. Hearing is believing.

I’ve also had good luck fishing in the waters of Radio.net. And I found some interesting, net-only stations on Internet-radio.com, although the entries on its “Featured” list suggest paid-for positioning. The top picks there are Classic Rock Florida HD, Smooth Jazz Florida, and Modern Jukebox Radio.

Radio.Garden is the most playful and eccentric aggregator of all. This highly engaging, super-fast search tool can be easily planted on a smartphone or tablet via an iOS or Android app. (But the site was characterized as “not secure” and needing third-party software intercession before I could load it on my iMac.) Open this thing up on a screen and you’re presented an animated map of the world. Tap a location dot and up pops selected picks from the immediate area and nation.

Now tap Search and the gardener provides immediate access to radio outlets by country, city or call letters, plus bouquets of “Our Favorite Stations,” playfully categorized as Independent Stations, Energetic Rhythms (electronic, dance), Time Travel (content from decades gone by), Weird Frequencies (like Theatre Organ Radio and Birdsong Radio), and Ends of the Earth (self-explanatory). As I write, I’m listening to a very trippy electronica outlet from Bristol, UK: Noods Radio. The eerie, otherworldly strains make me feel like I’m living in a very strange movie.

To my mind, true internet radio stations are independent, curated, and free; they’re not corporate, computerized, and costly. You might not hear a DJ’s voice or even see a meta-data screen tag identifying the artists and tracks on a station like KCRW-Eclectic24. (That’s where song-identifying services like Shazam come in handy.) And hours or even days of programming might be scheduled in advance on the studio’s servers.

But the quirkiness of the selections, the themes laid out in the segues indicate the presence of a human being, not an algorithm, making the aesthetic calls and structuring the playlist. And when necessary, the shows can be turned on a dime. A recent, hour-long afternoon “sweep” of rustic folk classics like Sam Stone and Illegal Smile playing on Eclectic24 was all the announcement I needed to know that John Prine had just died, and that someone at the station was mourning and paying tribute.

Internet radio used to get a deserved rap for sound quality “approaching AM quality.” No longer. The lossy digital compression schemes deployed in mid-1990s streaming audio players like RealAudio and Nullsoft were crude and extreme, with low bit rates chopping off each song’s head, tail, and feet to squeeze it through the modest data pipe available to private internet users at the time.

Even into the early 2000s, it was common to find “perceptual coded” MP3 streams running at rates as low as 16Kbps—buying into the psycho-acoustic theory that louder sounds obscure quieter ones, so why bother to shove all that “extra” data down the pipe? MP3 freaked the hell out of discerning musicians like Neil Young, who knew what was being lost in translation.

The story is different today, judging from VTuner’s posted transmission rates (information users can also call up on Como Audio radio displays). Even technically and financially strapped stations in third-world countries are serving up MP3 content encoded at 48-, 56-, and 64Kbps, or else working with the more efficient AAC codec at bit rates of 32- or 48Kbps, typically with a sampling rate of 44.1kHz. In more sophisticated web-radio operations, bit rates from 128- to 192-, and even 320Kbps are becoming increasingly common, with the latter characterized as “high resolution.”

“The only downside to streaming at 320Kbps,” Skiera says, “is that you might run out of network capacity on the home network when you have five connected speakers all playing at the high-resolution rate.”

Como Audio speakers (and some rival brands) also support the rarely used MPEG-DASH, ASF and podcast-securitizing HTTPS formats. Skiera says Como has no intention of integrating lossless codecs like FLAC and MQA into its radios. The latter is expensive to license and integrate, and I would argue that you won’t notice the higher quality on a compact speaker. Skiera tells me he “has not heard of any streaming radio stations migrating to those formats.”

Internet radio started out in the early 1990s as a hobbyist’s plaything, first cousin to “ham” shortwave radio. Then the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 imposed a burdensome royalty payment structure on any web-station with more than a couple hundred listeners. That buried a bunch of those basement startups. Today, only the stronger survive.

While late to the party, almost every local broadcast station on earth (commercial and non) now has a simulcasting online stream. A great equalizer, internet radio turns a low-power community station loose on the world with almost the same weight as a 50,000-watt big-city blaster. (While it has broadcast with as little as 580 watts—and is now up to 13K directional—the Martha’s Vineyard adult alternative station WMVY has consistently placed among the Top 20 most listened-to internet stations, worldwide. Not too shabby.)

Internet radio simulcasts are also a lifeline to listeners in dense urban locations, where broadcast FM signals are fraught with multipath distortion. In my hood, the online versions of favorite locals like non-commercial alternative WXPN and jazz/classical WRTI sound as pristine as a CD, while the FM broadcasts sputter on my speakers like a worn vinyl record.

The ability to import distant signals has also proven a welcome development for displaced citizens—especially relocated sports fans who still want to follow their favorite teams with a distant web tune-in. Ditto with displaced foreigners who crave to hear their native tongue.

I happily connect with government-supported, ad-free stations in locations like Britain, Germany, and Denmark, because those outlets’ format choices are often far more liberated than you’d typically find on public stations in the U.S.. Yeah, Afro-pop, Reggae, Prog-rock, R&B, and Hip-Hop are in the public interest, too!

Pandora, Spotify et al are not internet radio

Some folks lump on-demand music services like Pandora and Spotify in their “best of internet radio” roundups. Yes, those services stream on the internet and are accessible on the same computers, phones, set-top boxes, and smart speakers. But to ex-radio broadcasters like Como Audio’s Skiera and myself (being a former programmer/presenter of FM free-form shows on WMMR and WYSP in Philadelphia), it’s anathema to slot a “music genome”-powered Pandora or an on-demand library like Spotify in the internet radio category. While those services do offer New Music Playlists and radio-format-like caches of music labeled “Alternative,” “Dance/Electronic,” “R&B,” “Soul/Funk,” and so on, services like those are can be more accurately described as online jukeboxes.

Satellite radio broadcaster SiriusXM’s channel lineup is likewise available in the U.S. (and expanded) on many streaming home devices, computers, and smartphones through an internet radio-styled portal. But even without the core car play, they aren’t giving it away. Depending on lineup size and bonus features, the 200-to-300 channel “at home” package will set you back $8 to $13 a month.

I hope I’ve piqued your interest in internet radio. In next week’s installment, I’ll show you how to find the kinds of music you like most, and I’ll share more of my personal picks—the stations I keep going back to.

Wondering what the NFL Draft will look like from a coach's perspective tonight?

Well, San Francisco 49ers head coach Kyle Shanahan has a preview for you. The Niners' head man gave a tour of the makeshift NFL Draft war room setup in his home, and it appears to include five monitors, three laptops, an iPad, a wall-mounted television, and two landlines.

The preview came via a video posted to Twitter on Wednesday and includes a mini-tour of the downstairs of his home (it's shmancy), a meet-the-family-and-dog moment and one pretty wild tidbit: Shanahan will have 30 people (scouts, coaches, etc.) on Zoom during the draft, plus a personal Zoom with general manager John Lynch.

The most interesting part for Niners fans though may be a little Easter egg Shanahan doesn't discuss: Up on the wall-mounted TV is a clip from Alabama's 38-7 drubbing of Mississippi State on Nov. 16. The frame it's paused on comes just prior to a Tua Tagovailoa to Jerry Jeudy pass for a gain of 38 yards. In ESPN draft guru Mel Kiper Jr.'s final mock draft he has Jeudy going to the 49ers with the 13th pick in the first round. Jeudy is ranked 8th on Kiper Jr.'s final draft rankings.

Jeudy had seven catches for 114 yards in the aforementioned win against Mississippi State.

Andrew Cuomo said today.

Cuomo spoke about McConnell during his daily press briefing in Albany after the senator said on the Hugh Hewitt radio show he’d be open to allowing states to file for bankruptcy. McConnell has been pushing back against federal aid for state and local governments in recent days.

State bankruptcies would cause even further economic chaos, Cuomo said.

“You want to see that market fall through the cellar? Let New York state declare bankruptcy,” he said. “Let California declare bankruptcy. You will see a collapse of this national economy. So — just dumb.”

Cuomo also criticized McConnell, a Republican from Kentucky, for a news release with a section on “blue state bailouts.”

The states hardest hit by the virus have been predominantly Democratic and McConnell's language suggests lives in those places are worth less than others, said Cuomo, a Democrat.

""Don't help New York because it is a Democratic state. How ugly a thought,"" Cuomo said. ""I mean, just think of what he's saying.

""This is not the time or the place or the situation to start your divisive politics.""

Cuomo has been calling for weeks for more federal help for New York. He has warned of steep spending cuts for local governments and schools if Congress doesn't provide aid.

He said he wanted the state’s representatives to insist on money for states in a new aid bill expected to pass the House of Representatives soon. Most of the money in the new bill will fund small business loans.

Cuomo said it makes no sense to ignore states and local governments when they are the ones that will face most of the expenses involved in restarting the economy.

The severe weather, which was first reported at about 5:30 p.m. Wednesday, killed a least three people and injured about 33 others in Polk County alone. Four of these individuals are in critical condition.

KHOU 11 Chief Meteorologist David Paul said the storm system tracked more than 200 miles across multiple states over a six-hour period on Wednesday. The Associated Press and CBS News reported there were at least four other deaths outside of Texas, including a trailer factory worker whose body was found a quarter mile from his workplace in Marshall County in southern Oklahoma. A second death was also reported in that same county. Also, a woman was killed on a bridge in Woodworth, Louisiana, 15 miles south of Alexandria. A man died in Louisiana when he went out in the storm to get a trash can, the AP reported.

""We do not need any spontaneous volunteers. At this time, we have the personnel we need on site and we will request additional personnel if needed through mutual aid agreements and the State.""

Some photos that were taken near Onalaska High School show substantial storm damage. Amanda Price said her brother-in-law noticed that the pressure felt off and held onto the laundry door as the storm blew the back door off of his house. Price said he lives on Vince Drive in Onalaska.

An area power company said about 9,000 people were left without power after several transmission lines were damaged. The company also said the tornado caused extreme damage to power lines in the area and it's unclear how long it will take to make the repairs.

However, the organisation have also stressed that the health and safety of all involved is the priority - and have explained what should happen for European qualification if leagues cannot be completed.

The UEFA Executive Committee met once more via videoconference on Thursday and later urged all national associations to explore all possible options to finish domestic campaigns.

In the event this is not possible, qualification for European competitions should be decided on a new system of ""sporting merit"".

A statement from UEFA, released this afternoon, read: ""As a result of representations made by the football authorities in Belgium and Scotland, the Committee recognises the issues raised and approved the Guidelines on eligibility principles for 2020/21 UEFA club competitions. The Guidelines reflect the principle that admission to UEFA club competitions is always based on sporting merit.

""Therefore, UEFA urges National Associations and Leagues to explore all possible options to play all top domestic competitions giving access to UEFA club competitions to their natural conclusion. However, UEFA stresses that the health of players, spectators and all those involved in football as well as the public at large must remain the primary concern at this time.

""The ideal scenario, should the pandemic situation permit it, is to have the currently suspended domestic competitions completed enabling football clubs to qualify for UEFA club competitions on sporting merit in their original format.

""Should this outcome not be possible, in particular due to calendar issues, it would be preferable that suspended domestic competitions would restart with a different format in a manner which would still facilitate clubs to qualify on sporting merit.""

The Premier League was suspended last month for the foreseeable future as the UK government confirmed a lockdown across the country, which was recently extended.

Questions still hang over the completion of the current campaign, with the Premier League themselves continually stating their desire to finish the competition.

UEFA have continued to lay out the legitimate reasons a season might be brought to a halt.

The statement said: ""While using best efforts to complete the domestic competitions, National Associations and/or Leagues might have legitimate reasons to prematurely terminate their domestic competitions, in particular in the following cases:
• existence of an official order prohibiting sports events so that the domestic competitions cannot be completed before a date that would make it possible to complete the current season in good time before the next season to start.
• insurmountable economic problems which make finishing the season impossible because it would put at risk the long-term financial stability of the domestic competition and/or clubs.

""If a domestic competition is prematurely terminated for legitimate reasons in accordance with the above conditions, UEFA would require the National Association concerned to select clubs for the UEFA club competitions 2020/21 based on sporting merit in the 2019/20 domestic competitions.

""The procedure for selecting clubs should be based on objective, transparent and non-discriminatory principles. National Associations and Leagues, should otherwise have the ability to decide the final positions in their domestic competitions, having regard to the specific circumstances of each competition.

""The final determination of eligible places for the UEFA club competitions should be confirmed by the relevant competent bodies at domestic level.""

UEFA also confirmed that the European Championships, now rescheduled for 2021, will still be called ""EURO 2020""."
505,505,http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/nation/2020/04/103_288415.html,Mystery continues: Photos of Kim Jong-un missing from North Korea media coverage,Mystery continues: Photos of Kim Jong-un missing from North Korea media coverage,www.koreatimes.co.kr,"North Korea's state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported Wednesday that the country's leader Kim Jong-un sent a letter to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to thank him for the message sent in recognition of the 108th birthday of Kim Il-sung, North Korea's founding leader.

 Such reports on the North Korean leader's diplomacy activities are seen as usual routine in state media, but are receiving significant attention this time, as speculation has been mounting on Kim's physical condition, following recent reports of a suspected cardiovascular surgical procedure. While some claimed Kim's condition was improving after the suspected surgery, others claimed he was in serious condition. 

 Whether Kim had the surgery and whether he is in serious condition or is in recovery remains unknown, as North Korean media has not been featuring images of Kim in reports of his letter diplomacy with partner countries. Earlier on Monday, the KCNA also reported that Kim sent a congratulatory message to Cuban President Miguel Mario Diaz-Canel Bermudez. 

 There were several cases in the past in which Kim had been out of the public eye, but speculations over his physical condition have mounted, especially due to his absence from a floral tribute ceremony at the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun in Pyongyang to commemorate the birth of his grandfather Kim Il-sung. It is the first time he has missed the celebration since he took power in 2012. 

 Cheong Wa Dae, however, said Tuesday that ""there have been no unusual trends"" regarding Kim's activities. An official with the Ministry of Unification on Thursday echoed the presidential office's stance.

 ""It is unusual that Kim did not attend the tribute at the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun, but we need more time to see what is going on,"" the official said. ""When there were rumors that Kim Il-sung had been shot in 1986, North Korea showed images of him on state media instead of directly responding to the speculations. North Korea has never made an official response to such rumors on the death of its leader.""

 But voices from the National Assembly were different from the government. Rep. Yoon Sang-hyun of the main opposition United Future Party, the head of the National Assembly Foreign Affairs and Unification Committee, said Tuesday that the recent reinstatement of Kim Yo-jong, the powerful younger sister of Kim Jong-un, coupled with Kim's absence in recent political events were evidence that North Korea is undergoing an unusual situation. 

 ""I understand a serious matter happened to Kim and it seems that he received cardiovascular surgery,"" Yoon said, adding that this is not from a governmental source but he heard it from a ""most trustful"" source in South Korea. 

 Tae Ku-min, a former senior North Korean diplomat who has been elected in the April 15 general election, said in a statement Tuesday that the personal condition of Kim and his family members are protected national secrets in the North and even high-ranking officials do not know such information. 

 ""When Kim Il-sung died at 2 a.m. July 8 in 1994, no more than five people knew at that moment. When Kim Jong-il died in December 2011, North Korea announced his death after 51 hours and 30 minutes at noon on Dec. 19,"" Tae said. ""But the responses from the North Korean state media on the rumors are noteworthy. On Jan. 7, Kim Jong-un made a public appearance just four days after the U.S. killed (Iranian major general Qasem) Soleimani to show his strong will to fight against the U.S. But it is quite unusual that North Korea is not showing any response when it has been over a week since such rumors have emerged.""

 U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Vice Chairman Gen. John Hyten said Wednesday (local time) during a Pentagon press briefing that he assumes Kim is still in full control of his country's armed forces."

25 States have recorded cases of coronavirus with 782 confirmed cases as at 11:25 pm on April 21 with 25 deaths.

The Governors, operating under the aegis of the Nigeria Governors’ Forum (NGF), reached the agreement after receiving a briefing from the Governors of Lagos, Bauchi, Oyo and Ogun States who shared their experiences and lessons from the fight against COVID-19.

A communiqué issued by the NGF chairman and governor of Ekiti State, Kayode Fayemi, at the end of the sixth COVID-19 teleconference meeting said only essential services would be permitted during the national lockdown.

Fayemi said: “Governors unanimously agreed to the implementation of an inter-state lockdown in the country over the next two weeks to mitigate the spread of the virus from state to state. Only essential services will be permitted.”

“In order to strengthen coordinated implementation of necessary public health recommendations across states, governors resolved to set up COVID-19 committees at the regional level, headed by their state Commissioners of Health.

“Regional committees will continue to interface with the State Task Force Committees on COVID-19 already established in each state."

Here's how they're trying to steal your stimulus payment from under your nose.,www.cnbc.com,"If you're awaiting a federal stimulus payment and you haven't filed tax returns, beware: Hackers have set their sights — and sites — on your $1,200 check. Scammers have set up more than 180,000 coronavirus-themed websites in an attempt to steal data or misinform consumers, according to data from Checkphish by Bolster. The security firm has spotted more than 149,000 suspicious domain registrations with the term ""stimulus check"" in them. Last week, the IRS began distributing its economic impact payments to households all over the country. Individuals are eligible for up to $1,200, while those who are married and file jointly can get up to $2,400. Households are also eligible for $500 per child under age 17.

The IRS determines what you get based on the adjusted gross income reported on your 2018 or 2019 tax return. Single filers with an AGI between $75,000 and $99,000 ($150,000 and $198,000 if you're married and filing jointly) get smaller payments. Non-filers – people who don't submit tax returns because they don't earn enough money to be required to do so – are also eligible for stimulus checks. They must enter their personal data into a website hosted by the IRS to have the money direct deposited into a bank account. ""The IRS is asking consumers for their mailing addresses, email addresses – it's all appropriate information,"" said Rivka Little, senior vice president of marketing and strategy at Socure. ""But all of those points of data are out there; they're already breached and attainable,"" she said.

In 2019, there were 7,098 data breaches, exposing more than 15.1 billion records, according to data from Risk Based Security. In some cases, individuals themselves offer their own data on a silver platter via social media. This is why you shouldn't share your birthday, full name, email address and other details. Armed with this data, scammers could try grabbing non-filers' stimulus payments and routing the cash elsewhere. ""Now, it's fraudsters entering consumers' information in order to divert the money,"" Little said. ""It's important for financial institutions to watch for a rise in new bank accounts. ""Are you looking at the activity that happens after this new account is established?""

Rip-off artists are also impersonating the IRS and sending phishing emails to extract taxpayers' bank account data, said Avi Shua, co-founder of Orca Security. ""One easy way for scammers to take advantage of the 'Get My Payment' app is to create copies of the login page,"" said Abhishek Dubey, CEO of Bolster. Taxpayers wind up inputting their own data into the fake page, which scammers then use to try beating the victim to the check, he said. ""Even if it looks legit, if you want to search for the 'Get My Payment' site, go there directly – don't just click on a link within an email,"" Shua said. As a reminder, the IRS will not call, email, text or leave threatening voicemails about the stimulus payments – but scammers impersonating the tax agency will. ""The IRS reminds taxpayers that the new tools on IRS.gov – Get My Payment and the Non-Filer – are safe and secure to use,"" said IRS spokesman Dean Patterson in an email. ""Taxpayers are urged to go directly and solely to IRS.gov to use these tools and official information to avoid scams directing people to other websites,"" he wrote. More from Smart Tax Planning:

“There’s two very tribal camps out there, and they sort of pigeonholed everybody into one side or the other: Either we open tomorrow or we stay closed indefinitely as we are,” said Americans for Prosperity Wisconsin director Eric Bott. “I think that’s a false choice.”

Public Health Madison and Dane County spokeswoman Sarah Mattes issued a warning against attending the protest, arguing that staying home as much as possible provides the quickest path to reopening the economy.

“We understand that people are frustrated, but during a pandemic, a mass gathering is a dangerous way to express frustrations,” Mattes said in an email. “We recommend that everyone in our community stay home as much as possible and avoid going out except for essential trips — which this is not.”"

The executive order included a number of exemptions and was not a full suspension of legal immigration, as suggested by a Trump tweet late on Monday night.

Here is what Trump’s order does and does not do.

WHO WILL BE AFFECTED?

The order blocks some foreigners outside the United States from settling permanently in the United States by obtaining what is informally known as a “green card.”

The measure applies to both requests for permanent residence based on employment in the United States and requests based on familial ties but contains a number of exceptions.

The order does not affect people coming to the United States on non-immigrant visas, including tourists and business travelers. It also does not affect workers such as farm laborers entering the United States on temporary visas or skilled workers on H-1B visas.

Foreigners already in the United States and seeking to adjust their status will not be blocked by the latest measure.

The vast majority of employment-based green cards are granted to people inside the United States, and thereby not covered by the ban. Most family-based green cards are granted to people outside the country, however.

The immediate impact of the order was not clear since most U.S. consulates around the world have already shuttered most immigration processing services.

Doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals will be exempt, as will other prospective immigrants coming to the country to perform “essential” work to combat the new coronavirus, as determined by federal agencies.

The measure also excludes immigrants applying for the EB-5 visa program, which allows foreigners willing to invest large sums of money in U.S. projects that create or preserve jobs to obtain permanent residence.

The order makes an exception for spouses of U.S. citizens and their unmarried children under the age of 21.

The measure contains several other exemptions, including a general exemption for “any alien whose entry would be in the national interest.”

HOW LONG WILL THE SUSPENSION LAST?

The suspension will begin just before midnight on Thursday and last 60 days. After that, Trump will review U.S. economic conditions and decide whether it should be extended. Future extensions could potentially be longer than 60 days, Trump said this week.

WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO TEMPORARY FOREIGN WORKERS?

The executive order states that the administration will review all temporary visa programs - including guest worker programs - to determine if additional steps should be taken to protect U.S. workers.

A senior administration official told Reuters this week that the White House was considering a separate action that could deal with skilled workers who enter the country on H-1B visas and others affected by U.S. immigration policy.

DOES TRUMP HAVE THE POWER TO SUSPEND IMMIGRATION?

Trump’s latest immigration order draws on the same legal authority his administration cited in its 2017 travel ban that suspended the entry of travelers and immigrants from seven majority-Muslim nations. While that policy cited security concerns, critics dubbed it a “Muslim ban.”

Federal judges blocked several iterations of the ban from taking effect, but the Supreme Court eventually upheld a reworked version of the measure in 2018 and it continues to be in force and was expanded in January.

Some legal experts argue the high court’s ruling does not permit a broad, worldwide ban on immigration into the United States and expect Trump’s latest order to be challenged in court.

WHAT DOES IMMIGRATION LOOK LIKE NOW?

The United States suspended routine visa services in most countries worldwide in mid-March due to the coronavirus outbreak, which was expected to dramatically slow legal immigration.

In addition, countries around the world have closed their borders and enacted quarantines to limit the spread of the virus, greatly reducing travel worldwide.

Amid the global slowdown, the number of permanent residency visas issued by the State Department fell to around 24,000 in March, a 35% decrease from the previous month, according to department statistics published on Thursday.

The number of temporary visas issued also decreased by roughly a third.

WOULD BLOCKING IMMIGRANTS HELP THE ECONOMY?

Trump said on Tuesday that an immigration suspension would protect U.S. workers, an extension of the message he employed during his 2016 presidential campaign.

However, researchers generally agree that immigration into the United States has actually stimulated economic growth, increased the size of the economy and created jobs, according to Giovanni Peri, an economics professor at the University of California, Davis.

“The idea that immigration threatens American jobs is just not there in any data,” he said."

According to a statement issued on Wednesday, Sonke says the supposed letter calls on inmates who test positive for Covid-19 to inform their next of kin to sue the Department of Correctional Services (DCS).

The ""letter"" also speaks to parole decisions being made by the National Council for Correctional Services (NCCS).

The group has dismissed the letter.

""The letter is framed in unacceptably disparaging terms. Sonke unreservedly denies authoring the letter, providing permission for the use of our logo, or authorising the circulation of this letter,"" the statement read.

""We do not condone the content contained in the letter and Sonke would also like to state that we do not know the identity of the author, 'Advocate Mantombi S Ntombela'.

""While Sonke remains concerned about the health of South Africa's incarcerated persons, we acknowledge that there are appropriate processes for addressing this - in a way that supports DCS staff and protects the safety of detainees.""

Sonke considered letters such as the fake one being circulated, as well as any instigatory calls by organisations to be reckless and counter-intuitive.

""We call on whoever is behind this fake letter to desist from such a practice, which is likely to expose inmates into more vulnerability at this critical time.

""Sonke will also be communicating the same message to the DCS, and will continue to offer our support during these trying times,"" it added."

Bosses at Jessie’s Kitchen, a family-run cafe on Albert Road, were approached by the Japanese state broadcaster last week asking if they would be interested in taking part in a news piece about UK businesses.

Owner Ross Turriff, who runs the business with his wife Jacquie, explained: “Obviously filming in an issue just now so they asked us to film a few pieces around the place ourselves. We did that and sent them across to Tokyo, then we did an online interview with one of the presenters on Saturday afternoon.

“It was edited together and then broadcast across Japan on Tuesday around 8pm their time.”

The show was shown on NHK World-Japan, which is the international arm of the Japanese state-owned broadcaster NHK, and Ross admits taking part in the piece was welcome distraction in these times of uncertainty.

“We were flattered when they got in touch and quite interested in how they had stumbled upon us,” he said.

“The cafe side of things is completely closed and at this time of year our garden centre would normally be going like a fair so it was nice to have a wee bit of fun and to do something different.

“One of the researchers said that he can’t wait to visit Jessie’s when things get back to normal, so we’re looking forward to that.”

Although the business is not operating as it normally would, Ross and his wife are still going the extra mile to help those in the local community.

He said: “We have been getting boxes of fresh fruit and vegetables and essential items out to those who are isolating or shielding just now.

It's been a strange year so far to say the least……One of the most 'out of the blue' things may have been getting a call last week asking if we'd like to be a part of a nationwide Japanese TV show on NHK WORLD-JAPAN about how UK businesses are adapting and changing their ways to meet customers needs in these interesting times.It was broadcast all over Japan this evening and NHK were kind enough to send our bit over to let us see.If your Japanese is as poor as ours then you'll have to believe us that we were discussing veg Boxes, local produce, our great suppliers, adapting our business and our very popular Take Away Aftenoon Teas….Thank you NHK WORLD-JAPAN for including Jessie's!

“We’re delivering it to people’s doors and trying to help out. And we have also converted afternoon tea into a takeaway format so we have had pop-up afternoon tea sets that people can buy.

“It’s a skeleton staff we are working with at the moment so we are doing long hours and the best we can.”"

Mark. A. Mattiace, 42, pleaded...",www.vnews.com,"BURLINGTON — An East Corinth man who pleaded guilty to having explosives in his car last year will remain in jail until his sentencing despite the outbreak of COVID-19, a U.S. District Court judge ordered last week.

Mark. A. Mattiace, 42, pleaded guilty in January to one count of possession of explosive devices for the July incident on Interstate 91 in Hartford, according to federal court documents. Mattiace also had a hand grenade without powder in the car, documents said.

The documents did not indicate what sentence the plea deal carries, and emails to the prosecutor and Mattiace’s attorney, Michael Desautels, were not returned Wednesday.

In a motion this month, Desautels requested that Mattiace be released from the Essex County Correctional Center in Lewis, N.Y., until his sentencing on May 11 due to the outbreak of COVID-19. In the motion, Desautels wrote that Mattiace is diabetic, making him at increased risk of complications from the virus.

He wrote that “numerous courts” have granted release for inmates like Mattiace with pre-existing conditions, due to the new coronavirus and the risk of inmates catching the virus.

“Prisons and jails are among the worst places to prevent, contain, and control the outbreak of an infectious disease,” Deusatels said in the motion.

He also argued that Mattiace is not at risk of fleeing since he’s lived in Vermont for two years and doesn’t have the financial means to leave, and that he doesn’t pose a threat of violence.

But U.S. District Court Judge William Sessions denied the request in an order last week, saying there’s nothing in the motion to suggest that Mattiace wouldn’t be a flight or safety risk.

During the July traffic stop, police found methamphetamine, a blasting cap, detonation cord and pentaerythritol tetranitrate, an explosive material, in Mattiace’s car, according to an indictment. The seized grenade did not have powder, but the other explosive items were a problem, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives Agent Scott Murray said in a court affidavit.

Mattiace is barred from possessing explosives because he is a felon, records show. He has six felony convictions, including two for drug charges in Coos County in northern New Hampshire, the ATF said in court records.

The unprecedented emergency fund, first floated by the government last week, would borrow an extra $24.5 billion to create a financial buffer for the state amid the coronavirus crisis.

Parliament was recalled for the day to operate under strict social distancing rules that limited the number of MPs in the Legislative Assembly to half.

Debate on the massive financial package stretched into the night, however it was expected to garner bipartisan support.

An omnibus Bill was passed to deliver a $500 million rent relief package and ban on evictions, as well as a raft of temporary changes to the health system and the option of judge-only trials.

Premier Daniel Andrews said more than $1 billion a week — $32 billion over the next six months — was being wiped from the economy and the urgent relief was needed.

“They are the smart and right thing to do — borrow to build that bridge to the other side of this pandemic, and then work really, really hard every day to grow jobs, to build confidence to get things done,” Mr Andrews said.

It came after the government rejected an Opposition bid for an oversight committee to scrutinise the response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Mr Andrews said the government would be kept to account by the Public Accounts and Estimates Committee, and on Thursday added crossbencher David Limbrick to the panel.

But Victorian Greens leader Samantha Ratnam said the committee was not suitable because it was controlled and chaired by the government.

“They are making extraordinary decisions on a daily basis and those decisions can’t be immune from adequate scrutiny,” she said.

Leader of the Opposition in the Upper House, David Davis, said the defeat was a blow to transparency, and had given the Andrews Government “permission to mark its own homework” on its pandemic response.

The state government’s $500 million rent relief package has been passed by the Victorian Parliament.

The relief package formed part of the government’s COVID-19 Omnibus Bill and will put a temporary ban on evictions and rent increases.

The Bill will also introduce a raft of wide-ranging temporary measures in response to the coronavirus crisis.

They include the option of judge only trials in a bid to try and clear a growing backlog of cases since the courts stopped jury trials last month.

Delays of up to three years are expected with the County Court alone estimating more than 700 matters will be impacted.

The legislation also gives magistrates the power to force criminals to wear electronic monitoring tags and give greater flexibility to courts to reduce person-to-person interaction.

Quarantine orders will also be allowed in prisons and youth justice facilities.

Almost all the provisions in the bill will sunset after six months.

Parliament was recalled for a special sitting today to deal with the bill.

The Legislative Council will now move to consider the $24.5 billion being sought by the government to set up an emergency fund.

Protesters have been moved on from a state forest but escaped being fined for apparent breaches of coronavirus restrictions, it has been claimed.

While Victorians are bunkered down at home and banned from recreational activities including camping and fishing, the logging protesters setup camp inside Victoria’s state forests.

On Monday police were called after campers set up between Poweltown and Gembrook south-east of Melbourne.

Logging contractor Brett Robbin said the group were recognised as known protesters.

Mr Robbin said it was ironic that the group were protesting to save forests but were ruining the integrity of the forest by building campfires and digging holes.

He said he was angry that they were flouting COVID-19 restrictions.

“There seems to be two sets of rules, one for us and one for them,” Mr Robbin said.

Mr Robbin said the protesters claimed to be homeless before being moved on by police.

“They are well known activists. And these people are breaking the rules day after day after day.”

Victoria Police have been contacted for comment.

Victoria’s coronavirus death toll has increased once again after a man aged in his 60s died overnight.

It brings the total number of deaths to 16.

But in a promising sign, only one new case of coronavirus was recorded overnight and the number of community transmissions has not increased.

Twenty-seven people are in hospital, including 10 in intensive care.

So far, 1251 people have recovered and more than 93,000 Victorians have been tested.

It comes as the ­Andrews Government considers the fast-tracking of big-­dollar construction projects as it plots how to reinvigorate ­Victoria’s economy.

The option of bringing forward billions of dollars’ worth of construction while also ­investing in more rail and road infrastructure is on the table.

The flow-on economic ­impacts could form the centrepiece of the road to ­recovery, along with tax reform.

Treasurer Tim Pallas is ­preparing to borrow up to $24.5 billion in emergency funding and has vowed to fight for every job under threat from the downturn caused by the pandemic.

State government modelling predicted the state’s economic output could drop by $32 billion over the next six months, putting 270,0000 Victorians out of work.

The government is looking at ways to kickstart the economic revival, including:

FAST-TRACKING construction of new schools and a maintenance blitz of old ones;

BOOSTING the number of major road and rail projects;

PARTNERING with super funds, businesses and councils to deliver more works; and

Plans are also under way for a revival of the state’s vital tourism and major events sector, once coronavirus restrictions are lifted completed.

Premier Daniel Andrews said Victoria’s infrastructure projects could grow to help support the jobs needed.

“We’ve got the biggest construction agenda in our nation and certainly the biggest in our state’s history,” he said.

“That is going to need to get bigger. We’re going to even do more in roads, rail, hospitals and schools.

“There are many different ways in which the government can work so, so hard to stand with every single worker, family and business that has been touched by this.”

“We know that some jobs will bounce back quickly, but for those that don’t we’ll be there to help workers and businesses every step of the way.”

Mr Pallas said he would not give up on any job under threat. “There will be a return to better economic times but it will take time,” he said.

“This is a testing time for the Victorian economy, but we’ll be fighting for every ­single job. We will work closely with the private sector and ­unions to support jobs and back businesses to get to the other side of this crisis.”

Reserve Bank chief Philip Lowe warned the tax and industrial relations system would need major reform. This may mean changes to GST and state land taxes.

Mr Pallas said reform, particularly on tax collection, would be a key driver in Victoria’s economic plan.

“We are keen to work with the commonwealth … and to recognise that we’ll have to reassess the way that the burden of taxation and the recovery effort falls within the economy,” he said.

Company tax cuts are back on the federal government’s agenda to grow the economy in the wake of the coronavirus crisis.

The government dumped plans for big business tax cuts before last year’s federal election, after several ill-fated efforts to force the changes through parliament.

But Prime Minister Scott Morrison has acknowledged the economy would no longer be able to keep growing “under the old settings”.

Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said Australia’s company tax rate — at 30 per cent for businesses with turnover above $50 million — was “still very high by international standards”.

“If you go to the US, it’s 21 cents in the dollar, in the UK it is 19 cents in the dollar and in Singapore it’s 17 cents in the dollar,” he said. “We will look at tax reform as an area of interest because we’re always looking for opportunities to cut taxes.”

It is understood the government is open to all options to stimulate growth after the pandemic, but does not want to raise taxes.

Mr Morrison held talks with US President Donald Trump on Wednesday, and the pair agreed the recovery needed to be led by business, not by government.

Business Council of Australia chief Jennifer Westacott said cutting company tax rates was crucial as she called for “pro-growth reforms” instead of “ideological turf wars”.

“We’re not asking … for us to have the lowest rate, we’re simply asking for a competitive rate, so that we can be a magnet for investment in this country,” she said. “We already have so many advantages, but we have one disadvantage, which is a tax rate that is so much higher than everywhere else in the world.”

Police Association boss Wayne Gatt has backed plans to permanently expand protective service officer patrols after the pandemic ends.

On Wednesday Victoria Police chief commissioner Graham Ashton told the Herald Sun PSOs were doing a “great job” preventing crime on the streets amid a spike in burglaries at vacant businesses. He said their work was proof they had capacity to protect the community beyond public transport.

“This evolution makes sense for community safety, and builds on the investment of successive governments in the PSO workforce,” he said.

“We believe it has merit both in this current context, and into the future.”

Police Minister Lisa Neville also credited PSOs for their “incredible work” and said legislation was under way to expand their roles.

Victorians are being urged to keep an eye on their alcohol intake after new figures revealed just how much we are indulging on booze during the coronavirus lockdown.

New data from a recent YouGov poll shows one in five households are buying extra alcohol during the COVID-19 pandemic, while a third are enjoying a drink each day.

And of the 1000 people surveyed, 70 per cent admitted to drinking more than usual.

The Heart Foundation on Wednesday warned against drinking in excess, particularly for those with pre-existing heart conditions.

Director of health strategy Julie Anne Mitchell said encouraging healthy drinking habits while at home was important.

An extra 21,000 internet dongles are being sent to Victorian students as the government responds to extreme demand due to remote learning.

The Victorian Government struck up a deal with Telstra to supply the gadgets, taking the total number of internet devices being offered to families in need to 26,000.

Priority will be given to senior secondary students, bushfire-affected communities and those who can’t afford internet at home.

Almost 50,000 laptops and tablets have also been loaned to Victorian kids through term 2.

Education Minister James Merlino said the new agreement with Telstra meant no child would miss out learning from home during this period.

“We’re … providing a device to every child that needs one as well as internet access to thousands of Victorian students,” he said

Victoria’s Rail, Tram and Bus Union have called for the introduction of hefty new fines for anyone caught coughing or spitting on public transport staff.

In a letter to the state government, state secretary Luba Grigorovitch urged for Victoria to follow new legislation introduced in NSW.

The laws, introduced in response to behaviour after the coronavirus outbreak, impose a $5000 penalty on anyone caught coughing and spitting on people making their way to work.

It comes after reports police officers and other frontline workers were being targeted over the past month.

“While the vast majority of the travelling public continue to practise good hygiene, social distancing and are respectful of others’ circumstances, there remains a minority who have used COVID-19 as a threat,” Ms Grigorovitch said.

She said more enforcement was needed.

Megan Imbres, Quibi's head of brand and content marketing, is leaving the company a few weeks after the shortform video streaming service launched.

The Hollywood Reporter has learned that Imbres sent an email to employees regarding her departure on Wednesday. In the email, Imbres said now that Quibi had launched she felt like it was ""an opportune time of transition where I can take some time to identify my next challenge."" Her note also thanked founder Jeffrey Katzenberg and CEO Meg Whitman.

The Wall Street Journal was first to report the news.

A former marketing executive at Netflix, Imbres joined Quibi in April last year and helped build the marketing team from scratch, overseeing all the fledgling company's go-to-market activities and brand media spend. Imbres helped develop Quibi's sizable Oscar night and Super Bowl ad campaigns.

In a statement to THR, a Quibi spokesperson said, ""Megan played an important leadership role in the development of Quibi’s unique brand. She helped build an all-star brand and content marketing team that is well-equipped to transition Quibi from pre-launch to launch. We wish her all the best in her next endeavor.”

Imbres is the latest high-profile exit from Quibi. Before launch, the streaming company lost head of partnerships and advertising Tim Connolly as well as head of daily content Janice Min and head of operations Diane Nelson.

Quibi, Katzenberg and Whitman's $2 billion bet on the future of mobile entertainment launched on April 6 with more than 50 shows, including content from the likes of Steven Spielberg, Antoine Fuqua and Guillermo del Toro. The platform offers shortform episodic programming designed to be viewed on the go and offers two pricing tiers — an $8-per-month ad-free offering and a $5-per-month ad-supported offering.

The company has raised around $1.75 billion in venture funding from two rounds from all of the major entertainment studios, as well as Alibaba, Liberty Global and Madrone Capital.

Despite launching during the coronavirus pandemic, the Quibi app had 1.7 million downloads during its first week, according to Whitman. The company said that downloads had reached 2.7 million by its second week of release. Whitman said at launch that the initial reaction ""exceeded our plans and expectations."""

Standing together at the State’s Emergency Operations Center, they launched a statewide testing strategy to test all symptomatic people, isolate confirmed cases, and expand public health surveillance tools. By building capacity to test as many as 20,000 Minnesotans per day, this increased testing and tracing will help improve control of this pandemic and support the safe re-opening of society.

“When Minnesota faces a challenge, we rise up—together,” Governor Walz said. “I’m proud to partner with Minnesota’s innovative health care systems and leading research institutions to pioneer how states can begin to move forward amid COVID-19.”

The partnership announced today will help to assure that every person in the State with symptoms of COVID-19 gets tested. Funded in part by $36 million from the COVID-19 Minnesota Fund, the partnership will establish capacity to deliver 20,000 molecular and 15,000 serology tests per day.

“This expanded testing capacity will be transformative to our COVID-19 response, especially for vulnerable populations: individuals living in congregate care settings or experiencing homelessness; communities of color and American Indians; and critical workers,” said Lt. Governor Peggy Flanagan. “By testing more people, we will build a better picture of how COVID-19 is impacting our state and how to combat it. I am grateful to the extraordinary health care professionals at the University of Minnesota, Mayo Clinic, and all of our health systems for making this partnership possible.”

The partnership will improve control of COVID-19 in Minnesota through increased public health surveillance and research. The Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) and its public health partners will simultaneously expand contact tracing efforts for better control of the infection. The partnership will help to identify and respond to emerging “hotspots” of infection. They will collect data on prevalence, geographic distribution, and barriers to care for the virus, and they will conduct groundbreaking research on COVID-19 to assure that tests are applied according to the best emerging science.

“We are pleased to roll out this new testing effort in partnership with the University of Minnesota and the Mayo Clinic,” Commissioner of Health Jan Malcolm said. “Having this greatly increased testing capacity will improve our understanding of how COVID-19 is spreading in Minnesota, and will provide key data to inform our decisions about how to protect Minnesotans.”

In partnership with MDH, the Mayo Clinic and the U of M will create a central lab to accommodate the expanded testing and a virtual command center in coordination with the health systems to monitor daily testing needs and coordinate rapid responses to outbreaks.

“Mayo Clinic has been leading the nation in COVID-19 testing since the pandemic’s emergence. As always, Mayo Clinic continues to put Minnesota first,” said William Morice, M.D., PhD, President of Mayo Clinic Laboratories. “Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, Mayo Clinic has prioritized Minnesota’s needs, offering the state unlimited access to Mayo’s unmatched testing capabilities and providing assistance and expertise whenever asked. Mayo’s commitment continues today as we pledge further support for Minnesota’s statewide testing strategy.”

“We are committed to our vital public health obligation of aggressively expanding access to COVID-19 testing throughout the state. It will be core to any effort to safely reopen our state” said Jakub Tolar, MD, PhD, Dean of the University of Minnesota Medical School. “This is a complex health challenge. It is only fitting that two of Minnesota’s pre-eminent research institutions answer the call together in our commitment to tackling this pandemic. We are deeply grateful to Governor Walz and Minnesota leaders for supporting this testing strategy.""

The expanded testing will include intensive testing of: vulnerable populations, including Minnesotans living in congregate settings and those experiencing homelessness; staff that serve vulnerable populations and health care workers; communities of color and American Indian populations; and workforce for critical infrastructure.

“As an organization that cares for and serves 1.2 million patients and 1.8 million health plan members, HealthPartners applauds Gov. Walz for his leadership in advancing a statewide COVID-19 testing vision,” said Andrea Walsh, president and CEO, HealthPartners. “This partnership will help us identify people who have the infection, prevent spread of disease, and protect our doctors, nurses and care teams. Expanding testing and contact tracing is a necessary building block to help us all work toward re-opening Minnesota.”

""I strongly support a comprehensive statewide SARS-CoV-2 testing program bringing together both core clinical laboratory and public health surveillance expertise,"" said Dr. Michael Osterholm, Regents Professor and director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.

The U of M is the State’s public research university with a presence in every county of the state and is a leader in transformational research into the basic and clinical science of infectious diseases. Mayo Clinic is a leader in developing clinical testing and scaling capacity, and serves as a national reference laboratory and also a leader in clinical and basic infectious disease research."
526,526,https://www.breitbart.com/asia/2020/04/23/pompeo-china-destroyed-early-coronavirus-samples/,Pompeo: China 'Destroyed' Early Coronavirus Samples,Secretary of State Mike Pompeo accused China of destroying samples of the Wuhan coronavirus collected early.,www.breitbart.com,"American Secretary of State Mike Pompeo accused the Communist Party of China on Wednesday of destroying samples of the Wuhan coronavirus collected early, making it far more difficult for scientists to trace the virus’s evolution or find its origin.

Pompeo’s accusation follows months of reports similarly indicating that officials at China’s National Health Commission instructed laboratories nationwide to destroy viral samples used to sequence the coronavirus’s genome, or identify it as a new type of virus separate from other coronaviruses such as the one that causes Sudden Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).

Pompeo was speaking at a press conference in which he explained the reasoning behind the Trump administration withholding funds to the World Health Organization (W.H.O.), until an investigation occurs into how it allowed China to actively hinder attempts to contain what became a pandemic.

“We strongly believe that the Chinese Communist Party did not report the outbreak of the new coronavirus in a timely fashion to the World Health Organization,” Pompeo told reporters. “Even after the CCP did notify the W.H.O. of the coronavirus outbreak, China didn’t share all of the information it had. Instead, it covered up how dangerous the disease is.”

“It didn’t report sustained human-to-human transmission for a month until it was in every province inside of China. It censored those who tried to warn the world, it ordered a halt to testing of new samples, and it destroyed existing samples,” Pompeo continued. “The CCP still has not shared the virus sample from inside of China with the outside world, making it impossible to track the disease’s evolution.”

Viruses can evolve very quickly, changing characteristics as they jump from person to person. The viral samples from patients in the United States may vary significantly from those in China or any other part of the world. Comparing them to early samples of the virus from China, however, is not possible anymore, Pompeo explained, as those samples do not exist.

Pompeo appeared to be confirming reports that first began circulating in February that the Chinese Communist Party actively destroyed scientific materials that could have helped the world better understand the Chinese coronavirus. In early February, the independent Chinese outlet Caixin Global cited an epidemiologist with sources in Wuhan who lamented that the Party had “disinfected” Wuhan’s notorious wet market, initially believed to be the origin of the virus. That month, Chinese officials claimed that the virus had infected humans from interaction with, and possibly consumption of, wild animal meat purchased at that market.

China shut down the market on January 1, according to early reports, and decontaminated the site, thereby destroying any biological samples scientists could have had access to.

“There’s no way for anybody to do the research to figure out where (the virus) came from,” epidemiologist Walter Ian Lipkin told the outlet. “We don’t have the information required to pinpoint it.”

China has since claimed a “study” showed the virus did not originate in the market at all and has promoted the unsubstantiated conspiracy theory that the U.S. Army manufactured the virus.

Later that month, Caixin published a report stating that samples of the virus existing in Chinese laboratories – presumably the only existing ones since those potentially at the market were no longer available – had been destroyed. According to the Caixin report:

On Jan 1, after several batches of genome sequence results had been returned to hospitals and submitted to health authorities, an employee of one genomics company received a phone call from an official at the Hubei Provincial Health Commission, ordering the company to stop testing samples from Wuhan related to the new disease and destroy all existing samples. The employee spoke on condition of anonymity, saying the company was told to immediately cease releasing test results and information about the tests, and report any future results to authorities. Then on Jan 3, China’s National Health Commission (NHC), the nation’s top health authority, ordered institutions not to publish any information related to the unknown disease, and ordered labs to transfer any samples they had to designated testing institutions, or to destroy them. The order, which Caixin has seen, did not specify any designated testing institutions.

Reports from some of these labs that the virus may have been related to SARS resulted in some on social media – notably, doctors in Wuhan – sharing tips on how to prevent contracting a communicable disease. China responded to those posts by arresting and disappearing the doctors. One of those doctors, Li Wenliang, later died after the Chinese government claimed he tested positive for the virus.

Legislation proposed by Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) and Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-TX) that would allow American citizens to sue China in American courts for damages related to the Chinese coronavirus also notes evidence that the virus samples were destroyed before international scientists could study them.

In his remarks Wednesday, Pompeo condemned the World Health Organization for not responding negatively to the clear signs that Chinese officials were hiding pivotal evidence to containing the virus.

“Not making a legal determination here today on China’s adherence to the IHRs [International Health Regulations], but the World Health Organization’s regulatory arm clearly failed during this pandemic,” Pompeo said, noting that some of those regulations demanded, among other things, prompt reporting of the outbreak and “any unusual or unexpected public health events such as SARS.”"

But what does it really do?,www.washingtonpost.com,"Although Trump had said on Twitter earlier in the week that he was going to suspend all immigration during the pandemic, the order he signed was much less broad and carries several exemptions.

A: The president suspended the entry of several categories of immigrants for 60 days who are currently outside of the United States and do not already have a valid immigrant visa to travel to this country.

This includes people seeking green cards for work, with some exceptions, as well as the spouses and children of legal permanent residents, also known as green-card holders, and the siblings, parents and adult children of U.S. citizens.

Also exempt are U.S. citizens’ spouses and children under age 21; health-care workers, particularly those fighting the coronavirus; wealthy immigrant investors; members of the U.S. military; special immigrant visa-holders such as Iraqi interpreters for the military; and a broad category of immigrants needed for police investigations or because their entry is broadly considered in the “national interest.”

Most immigrants, about 700,000 last year, obtain green cards through relatives who are U.S. citizens or to a lesser degree green-card holders. Citizens may apply for parents, spouses and children under 21. They can also apply for siblings and adult children, but that process can take years. Green-card holders may sponsor their spouses and children.

A smaller number, about 139,000 last year, obtain green cards through work, including superstar athletes and highly skilled scientists or laborers. The remainder are for special categories such as U.S. military interpreters in Iraq and Afghanistan, crime victims and unaccompanied minors. Congress created a new category for some Liberian nationals last year. And up to 50,000 green cards are issued in a yearly diversity lottery.

A: Immigrants are people born in a foreign country who come to live in the United States permanently. Most of the 43.7 million foreign-born people in the United States are in the country legally, according to the Census Bureau. Approximately 21 million of them are naturalized U.S. citizens. An estimated 10 million to 11 million more are in the United States illegally, according to the Pew Research Center. The remainder have green cards or another legal status.

Millions of foreign-born people come to the United States every year temporarily, for work, tourism, university studies, business and a host of other reasons. They pick apples in Washington state and strawberries in California, study at Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and they work as nurses in disadvantaged areas. Others are athletes or entertainers. Often their children and spouses tag along.

A: Yes and no. Trump made clear that there will be several carveouts to allow laborers such as medical professionals to come to the United States. But the Migration Policy Institute estimates that 26,000 would-be green-card holders will be blocked from arriving each month the order is in effect, starting Thursday.

A: An undocumented immigrant is a term used to describe the nearly 11 million people in the United States who do not have legal authority to stay in this country, according to the Pew Research Center.

Some are children, but most are adults working in the United States. Calling them undocumented is a euphemism because such immigrants often have passports from their native country and driver’s licenses in U.S. states that allow it. Some crossed the border illegally to gain entry into the United States. But others applied for visas, underwent background checks and then overstayed those visas."

A name that conjures up many images - mainly ones of him wheeling off to celebrate after tucking away another chance.

As brilliant as he was, there will always be a dodgy knee shaped dark cloud hanging over his career. A depressing reminder that as majestic as he was, he could, should and would have been even better if his body had allowed.

Let's not dwell on that though - there's enough misery in the world at the moment.

Instead, let's remember the good times, when Ronaldo was the most exciting footballer on planet earth. Specifically, 23 April 2003.

The stakes: a place in the ​Champions League semi final.

Protecting a 3-1 lead from the first leg, Los Blancos travelled to ​Manchester United knowing that playing out a conservative, low scoring draw would be enough to see them progress.

That's not quite the way it turned out though, with an inspired hat trick from Ronaldo the only thing preventing them from crashing out of the competition.

""Zidane to Guti. Moved quickly onto Ronaldo who's stolen a march on Ferdinand. RONALDO'S SHOT! Heartbreaker. Ronaldo with a blow to the hearts of Manchester United's hopes.""

Guti's got it in midfield. You remember him? The guy who looked a bit like a girl.

Ronaldo's mouth has started watering - he's managed to isolated Rio Ferdinand. If he can just shake off the world's most expensive defender he's in at goal here.

Peeling off the former Leeds man likes he's a satsuma skin, he races onto the end of Guti's slightly wayward pass.

The balls bobbling, badly. No bother though. Ronaldo channels his mystical energy and somehow manages to make a clean contact with the ball. It races past Fabien Barthez before the wee Frenchman even has time to shout, ""SACRE BLEU!""

""Zidane. Roberto Carlos. It's Ronaldo! That may be a goal two far. Real Madrid's second goal is surely a passport to the semi finals.""

This one is liquid football ​Manchester City goal scored just as Phil Foden was learning to talk.

The simplest of give and go's between Roberto Carlos and Zidane and suddenly the Real left-back is in the United box.

Of course, he cuts it back to his mate Ronaldo who thanks him by slotting it away nicely - much to the dismay of a particularly fed up looking John O'Shea.

McManaman, who looks happier than anyone about United being on the verge of crashing out of Europe. Well, you can take the boy of out Merseyside...

""Ronaldo. He's made space for himself. OOF! Pick that out. What a hat trick and what a stage on which to score it. Ronaldo has done some remarkable things in his young career but the three goals that he's scored tonight against Manchester United will rank high in his achievements.""

You can keep your free flowing passing moves. You can keep your nutmegs, your flip flaps, your roulettes.

The sort of footballers I like to watch are the ones who can kick the ball really, really hard into the goal. The harder the better to be honest.

That's what's so beautiful about this strike - the closer of Ronaldo's hat trick.

There's no nuance, no subtext and no hidden meaning here. This is just the best striker in the world at the time doing what he's paid to do - absolutely thump it into the back of the net.

The best thing about this goal is the sound as kisses the corner of the onion bag. I reckon I've replayed about 200 times so far while writing this article and I plan to give it another 500 or so listens before I go to bed tonight.

No wonder it got a standing ovation from the Old Trafford crowd.

Here's how parents can cope with a crowded household.",www.aarp.org,"""He's pretty miserable,” says his empathetic father, David Bergman, a city planning consultant. “The secret is to realize that this is a really hard time for any college-age student. It's harder on them than it is on us.""

Perhaps that is the single most pertinent piece advice for the millions of parents whose college-age kids were forced to return home to study in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic.

""Not only have they lost the life they thought they'd built for themselves, but they are younger than us and don't have the emotional reserves to realize that things will be OK,” Bergman says.

Well-meaning parents should consider taking a dozen additional actions to avoid all the anger, frustration and resentment that can build up in any home where family has been suddenly forced to shelter with their college-age kids, according to interviews with five child psychologists and authors on college student success. Experts say taking these helpful actions with your college students now can result in weeks — if not months — of greatly improved coexistence:
• Acknowledge their grief. College students now are struggling in ways they've never struggled before, says B. Janet Hibbs of Philadelphia, coauthor of The Stressed Years of Their Lives: Helping Your Kid Survive During Their College Years. “Acknowledge their grief. Don't be dismissive,” she says. “This is a big deal.""
• Avoid asking questions. When your kids are away at college, they function perfectly well without answering a lot of questions from mom and dad. So don't fall into that trap now, says Karen Levin Coburn, a licensed psychologist, senior consultant at Washington University in St. Louis and author of Letting Go: A Parent's Guide to Understanding the Parent Years. “You have an adult living in your house who has been doing just fine without you, so focus on the things that matter,” she says.
• Include them in decisions. This is a situation where everyone is in the same canoe and has to paddle together, says Anthony Rostain, M.D., chairman of the psychiatry and behavioral health department at Cooper University Health Care in Camden, New Jersey. He coauthored the college survival book with Hibbs. “This is really about the family making decisions together in order to survive this,” he says.
• Treat them as equals. It's critical to view your college-age children as problem-solvers, not problems to be solved, says Martie Bernicker, executive director of SpeakUp! in Devon, Pennsylvania, in the Philadelphia area. The nonprofit promotes teen dialogue with adults. Two of her sons are now home from college during the pandemic.

She says one successful way for parents to accomplish cohesion is to ask your college kids specifically, “What are we doing that is driving you crazy?” Listen to what they say. Then stop doing it."
530,530,https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/1272702/uk-coronavirus-peak-lockdown-have-we-reached-peak-dominic-raab,UK HAS reached coronavirus peak - but here's why lockdown won't be lifted,"BRITAIN has hit the peak of the coronavirus outbreak but must stay under lockdown to stop a fresh surge in cases, Dominic Raab said last night.",www.express.co.uk,"In an appeal to the country to stick to social-distancing rules, the Government’s First Secretary said restrictions on movement must remain in place “for the time being” to avoid a second shutdown later that could devastate the economy. “We’re making progress through the peak of this virus, but we’re not out of the woods,” he said. He also acknowledged many Britons were under an “immense mental strain” in obeying the draconian rules.

Meanwhile, Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty yesterday warned that the public should not expect deaths from the virus to fall “suddenly” and signalled that many social-distancing measures may have to remain in force for over a year until a vaccine can be found. The latest appeals for the nation to brace for a long haul in the battle against Covid-19 came after the latest official figures showed a further 665 hospital patients have died from the disease in the UK, taking the total to 18,100. Speaking at the daily Downing Street coronavirus briefing, Mr Raab said: “The measures we introduced must remain in place for the time being. “The greatest risk for us now, if we eased up on our social distancing rules too soon, is that we would risk a second spike in the virus with all the threats to life that would bring, and then the risk of a second lockdown which would prolong the economic pain that we’re going through.” Mr Raab, who is standing in while Boris Johnson recovers from his coronavirus infection, backed a warning yesterday from Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey that lifting restrictions too early could cause more long-term damage to the economy by leading to a second lockdown. “If we stick to our plan, if we take the right steps at the right time, we can get through this crisis, and I know we will,” the First Secretary said.

“Now I know it has been tough going for businesses, for families and for vulnerable members of our communities up and down the country. “It’s been a physical strain as we adapt to living and working at home while not seeing our family and our friends in the usual way we’d like to.” He admitted the lockdown had put an “economic strain” on businesses. “But it has also been an immense mental strain on everyone: people stuck at home, families worried about their finances and the elderly more isolated than we’d ever want them to be,” the Cabinet minister added. Also speaking at the Downing Street briefing, Prof Whitty warned the public not to expect the number of Covid-19 deaths to ""fall away"" suddenly. ""It is important for people to fully understand that... even in those countries which started their epidemic curve earlier than in the UK, and which are still ahead, the downward slope from the point which we change is a relatively slow one. ""We should anticipate the same situation in the UK. We should not expect this to be a sudden fall away of cases,” he said.

Prof Whitty added: ""We have to be very realistic if people are hoping it's suddenly going to move from where we are in lockdown to where suddenly into everything is gone, that is a wholly unrealistic expectation. ""We are going to have to do a lot of things for really quite a long period of time, the question is what is the best package and this is what we're trying to work out. ""If you release more on one area, you have to keep on board more of another area so there's a proper trade-off and this is what ministers are having to consider."" Prof Whitty also said social distancing measures will almost certainly have to remain in place until a vaccine or effective drugs to treat coronavirus can be found, which he warned was unlikely to happen this year. Only a vaccine or drugs to treat coronavirus could bring an exit from the health crisis, the Chief Medical Officer said. ""Until we have those, and the probability of having those any time in the next calendar year are incredibly small and I think we should be realistic about that. ""We're going to have to rely on other social measures, which of course are very socially disruptive as everyone is finding at the moment.”

He added: ""This disease is not going to be eradicated, it is not going to disappear so we have to accept that we are working with a disease that we are going to be with globally for the foreseeable future.” Earlier yesterday, Mr Raab defended the Government’s progress in extending coronavirus testing and providing protective equipment for NHS staff under intense questioning from new Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer in the Commons. Making his Prime Minister’s Questions debut as opposition leader, Sir Keir told Mr Raab: “The day before yesterday 40,000 tests could have been carried out, but only 18,000 tests were actually carried out. “All week, I have heard from the frontline, from care workers who are frankly desperate for tests for their residents and themselves, desperate. “They would expect every test to be used every day for those who need them. “There is clearly a problem. Why is the Government not using all the tests available every day?” He also claimed “something is wrong” in providing gowns, masks and other protective clothing for the NHS and alleged a “pattern” had emerged of the Government being “slow” to respond to the crisis.

Mr Raab insisted the Government would hit a target of 100,000 coronavirus tests a day by the end of the month. “Of course a project like this requires an exponential increase in the final days, the final week, of the programme. “I reassure him that we are working with a range of commercial partners to boost the testing to get to that 100,000 tests per day,” the First Secretary said. He added: “Since the start of the outbreak, we have delivered 1 billion items of personal protective equipment, and tens of millions have been distributed via the devolved administrations. “We recognise, though, that we have to strive even harder in this incredibly difficult and competitive international environment to source the equipment.” More than 23.6 million items of PPE [personal protective equipment] were delivered to 198 NHS trusts on Tuesday, the Prime Minister’s spokesman said yesterday. ""We continue to work hard to try to both boost the domestic capacity to produce PPE and to source it from within the UK and also to secure PPE orders from overseas,"" the Downing Street official said. The RAF could make further flights to collect PPE from overseas, Number 10 indicated. ""If there was more PPE to be collected and delivered from anywhere in the world then if the RAF could help then they will do so,"" the spokesman said."

On a recent group chat, one of my teacher daughters working remotely in north Florida texts: ""This makes me so sad. I talked to a parent today who said she spent the morning running around town looking for meat and toilet paper.""

All I can think to answer is one thing, and it comes from the heart.

Americans, in the midst of food and supply shortages and limitations on personal freedoms, are getting a taste of what it's like in Cuba and Venezuela _ without coronavirus.

Ever heard of surviving on only food bought with a ration book? Or standing in an hourslong line, and when your turn comes up, the bodega has run out of what you came for?

It's an everyday reality for the Cuban people, who after a short period of bounty and hope during President Barack Obama's opening to some trade and relations, were forced to return to sanctions, a tightening of the U.S. embargo, shortages, repression and economic mismanagement from their new Communist leadership.

It's the same story in Nicolas Maduro's socialist Venezuela, a country with the largest proven oil reserves in the world where children literally are dying of malnutrition, as the New York Times reported long before the coronavirus struck, and in the middle of the pandemic, the U.S. Department of Justice indicted Maduro. He and other top officials are charged with turning Venezuela into a narco-state by collaborating with a leftist Colombian guerrilla group that exported cocaine to the United States.

Now, desperate people in Caracas' poorest barrios, wearing towels as masks, defy quarantine in search of what isn't running through their old pipes and they can't live without: water.

""How can I wash my hands if there isn't water?"" asks a man on an EFE news agency video of people congregating to fill plastic jugs.

""I left behind a very sad Cuba,"" a Cuban woman who arrived recently in Miami with a tourist visa told me. She fled Cuba's delayed reaction to the coronavirus threat and the outrageous courting of foreign tourists in Europe when everyone else was closing borders to limit transmission.

""Everything is adrift, people lack information,"" the woman said. ""The food lines are unbelievable. Whatever is happening here is a huge improvement to being there.""

But, for Cuban Americans, what's happening in the United States rings of a familiar story.

Before the novel coronavirus sent us all in a frenzy to pack our refrigerators and pantries, I already suffered from an only-in-Miami form of PTSD, the growing up in Cuba kind.

It was bad enough that Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders' persistent praise of Fidel Castro and communist Cuba's education system threw me back to my police state childhood anxieties. Now here we are, in the good old USA, in the middle of food and supply shortages.

Wha-a-a-t, no malanga at my Cubanized Winn-Dixie?

The pollo is all gone at Publix!

The bountiful, international hot food and salad bar at Whole Foods is empty!

No fresh milk, no eggs _ and my mind throws me back into my father's car on a forbidden trip to the countryside to bring back to the city food supplies in post-U.S. embargo, ration card-only 1960s Cuba.

On the way back, green-fatigued milicianos intercept us. My mother starts to tuck meat and vegetables under her clothes, looking as if she were pregnant, as my father says to stay calm and gets out of the car. I don't know what he did but the grown-up me suspects he bribed them.

They walk around the car in a pretend search and wave us through the checkpoint.

The shortages were epic before we left Cuba for the United States in 1969. You were only allowed to buy, for example, one quarter of a loaf of bread per person. They only got worse.

Imagine what it was like for the people who stayed behind and lived through Cuba's ""special period"" in the early 1990s after the island lost Soviet subsidies. They had to make patties out of orange rinds and kids drank sugared water for breakfast. I remember my mother sending my cousin vitamin C tablets to treat scurvy, an end-of-the-18th-century disease.

Is it any wonder that an exodus to South Florida of people in homemade rafts and boats followed extreme hunger in 1994?

Or why, decades later, we're now suffering in the age of coronavirus a sort of Cuban American, Venezuelan American collective PTSD over shortages and shutdowns?

Our homeland experiences perhaps also explain why people in Miami-Dade are hoarders, whether it's when a hurricane looms in the Caribbean, or now, when we are preparing for a pandemic apocalypse that will keep us homebound who knows for how long.

They use the official state newspaper, Granma.

Meat is considered a delicacy, too expensive when available to people whose average salary is $44 a month.

This can happen in what we like to boast is the greatest nation on Earth.

532,532,https://www.sabcnews.com/sabcnews/increase-in-online-music-piracy-since-lockdown/,Increase in online music piracy since lockdown,,www.sabcnews.com,"The Recording Industry of South Africa (RiSA) says there has been an increase in online music piracy since the lockdown.

RiSA says statistics have shown that the Top 40 songs that were legally downloaded the most in the period preceding the lockdown dropped from 8170 songs a week, to 7 221.

According to Risa, some of the biggest hits in South Africa have been affected, with eMcimbini by Kabza de Small leading the pack.

Risa CEO Nhlanhla Sibisi says piracy hurts the artist the most.

“People share music on WhatsApp platforms, on Instagram or various other platforms without understanding the consequences this has, especially on musicians who spend most of the time recording and delivering good quality music. We are in fact depriving the very same musician of an income,” says Sibisi.

Award winning gospel ensemble Joyous Celebration is also among the hardest hit.

Their latest album Joyous 24, has been heavily pirated and songs are being shared on a WhatsApp line that is publicly asking music lovers to text so that they can receive the music.

Jabu Hlongwane from Joyous Celebration explains says: “People have really gotten to be on the computer and internet and programs to rip the music and steal the music. And there are many programs that do piracy. But we have found out that our program is being pirated but we have had talks with our company Sony music to try and stop that. The legal departments are following on that.”

Hlongwane says the piracy blow and cancellation of shows as a result of the lockdown will make it more difficult for artists to recover after the pandemic.

Events and Artist Manger Thabiso Tshabalala says some people genuinely do not know they are contributing to the illegal act as all they consider is affordability.

“The reason why the piracy is on the rise is because the core audience doesn’t understand the difference between a fakaza.com and Spotify. They don’t understand that the one platform is illegal and the other legal. They see it as free content on the one, and paid content on the other. That’s why we have such a big problem with piracy, it is not helping the artists. They use the content as a catalyst to get bookings. It’s killing the industry.”

Yet these digital platforms require data, which can be costly.

Hip hop DJ Bonolo Bmoe Seakgoe says this is because the legal platforms aren’t necessarily cheap and data costs in South Africa play a role and a lot of data is needed to stream the content.

Risa pleads with music lovers to refrain from piracy and only access music from legitimate sources."

Sign up here to receive this briefing daily by email, and stay abreast of developments both at home and abroad:
• Manchester and Liverpool are now seeing the most Covid-19 cases, according to the Health Service Journal.
• Social restrictions are to remain in place for at least the rest of the year, says chief medical officer Chris Whitty. Details below.
• Human trials begin today for vaccines in Germany and the UK. Matt Ridley weighs up the likelihood of Covid-19 treatments in the 10,000th issue of The Spectator magazine. More analysis below.
• The Portuguese nurse mentioned by name in the Boris Johnson address to the nation has spoken out about the experience, saying he is ‘extremely proud’ to have cared for the PM in the ICU.
• NHS Digital had to apologise to the families of over 10,000 deceased patients, after sending letters warning about their risks of contracting Covid-19.
• The leader of the ASCL headteachers’ union said that 1 June is the earliest ‘realistic’ date when schools could reopen. Children in Scotland may return to school part-time under a new rota system.
• Some 20,000 households in the UK are being asked to take part in a study to track the spread of Covid-19.

Covid-19 will not be expunged: we’ll have to learn to live with it. So said Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer, in the No. 10 briefing last night – and so the conversation moves on to minimising the second wave of Covid-19 infections. The seven NHS Nightingale hospitals lie almost empty, but are being maintained in readiness for a second Covid-19 spike. The world’s first experiment in trying to halt a virus means huge uncertainty over what happens when lockdown ends. Attention is now turning to this: questions on how to flatten the second wave or implement a face mask strategy circle round. As Dr John Lee writes, there is no evidence that masks are effective in the general public. Or what about apps, and trying to replicate a South Korean model? We can try, but there’s no certainty that they’d work. But with no sign of a vaccine, it will soon be time to experiment – and trust the public to show good sense as we go through the process of trial and error. Sage, the government’s scientific advisory group, has been asked to outline what that experiment might look like: all of it aimed at minimising, rather than avoiding, the second wave.

The first human trials for a Covid-19 vaccine in Germany and the UK start today. Some 500 people are taking part in Oxford University’s testing process, with 200 joining a trial run by BioNTech in Frankfurt. Oxford’s Andrew Pollard has said millions of doses could be ready by the autumn provided ‘nothing goes wrong in that complex process’ of clinical trials. But that’s a big if. As Matt Ridley explains in this week’s 10,000th issue of The Spectator magazine, there are about 80 vaccine trials worldwide – but the hunt for a cure is looking more promising. He’s optimistic that, within a month or two, one of the 30 or more therapies currently being tested is likely to prove effective and safe. But therapies are not vaccines – which is still months away, if we’re lucky. UK trials have started just as the chief medical officer Chris Whitty announced there will be some social distancing measures in place for the rest of the year, as we learn to live with the virus until ‘ideally’ a vaccine emerges.

While Covid-19 deaths have plateaued nationally, they are rising steeply in Greater Manchester where 1,052 hospital patients have died: only five fewer than in North West London, which felt the impact of the pandemic much earlier (Health Service Journal)

Podcast: What’s the Covid-19 effect on the NHS?

The NHS has been transformed to deal with the coronavirus threat, and it’s thus far holding up, despite fears over capacity. But what has been the effect on the rest of the health service, and its usual patients? Fraser Nelson speaks to Alastair McLellan, Editor of the Health Service Journal. Listen here.

Are smokers less at risk of contracting Covid-19? A new study from a hospital in Paris suggests ‘nicotinic agents could provide an efficient treatment for an acute infection such as Covid-19’, after it found ‘of those admitted to hospital, whose median age was 65, only 4.4 per cent were regular smokers. Among those released home, with a median age of 44, 5.3 per cent smoked.’ French researchers now plan to use nicotine patches to test virus patients and healthcare workers, to examine further the links between nicotine and Covid-19.
• The world is heading for an ‘unprecedented’ recession, as credit rating agency Fitch predicts global GDP will contract by 3.9% in 2020.
• Business activity has collapsed to record lows across the Eurozone, as the area’s purchasing Managers Index (PMI) has reached 13.5. The UK’s PMI fell to a record low of 12.9.
• 2.8 million workers in the UK have been placed on the government’s furlough scheme.
• The government will borrow £180 billion in the next three months to fund its Covid-19 rescue package. UK borrowing in 2020/21 is likely to surpass the 2009/10 record following the financial crash.
• Universities could miss out on £2.5 billion in tuition fees next year.
• South Korea’s GDP shrank 1.4% between January and March, its biggest fall since the 2008 financial crash.

535,535,http://www.navhindtimes.in/lockdown-in-india-has-impacted-40-million-internal-migrants-world-bank/,Lockdown in India has impacted 40 million internal migrants: World Bank,,www.navhindtimes.in,"The nationwide lockdown in India which started about a month ago has impacted nearly 40 million internal migrants, the World Bank has said.

“The lockdown in India has impacted the livelihoods of a large proportion of the country’s nearly 40 million internal migrants. Around 50,000–60,000 moved from urban centers to rural areas of origin in the span of a few days,” the bank said in a report released on Wednesday.

According to the report — ‘COVID-19 Crisis Through a Migration Lens’ — the magnitude of internal migration is about two-and-a-half times that of international migration.

“Lockdowns, loss of employment, and social distancing prompted a chaotic and painful process of mass return for internal migrants in India and many countries in Latin America,” it said.

Thus, the COVID-19 containment measures might have contributed to spreading the epidemic, the report said.

Governments need to address the challenges facing internal migrants by including them in health services and cash transfer and other social programmes, and protecting them from discrimination, it said.

World Bank said that coronavirus crisis has affected both international and internal migration in the South Asia region.

As the early phases of the crisis unfolded, many international migrants, especially from the Gulf countries, returned to countries such as India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh – until travel restrictions halted these flows.

Some migrants had to be evacuated by governments, such as those of China and Iran, it said.

Before the coronavirus crisis, migrant outflows from the region were robust, the report said.

The number of recorded, primarily low-skilled emigrants from India and Pakistan rose in 2019 relative to the prior year but is expected to decline in 2020 due to the pandemic and oil price declines impacting the Gulf countries.

In India, the number of low-skilled emigrants seeking mandatory clearance for emigration rose slightly by eight per cent to 368,048 in 2019.

In Pakistan, the number of emigrants jumped 63 per cent to 6,25,203 in 2019, largely due to a doubling of emigration to Saudi Arabia, it said.

According to the bank, migration flows are likely to fall, but the stock of international migrants may not decrease immediately, since migrants cannot return to their countries due to travel bans and disruption to transportation services.

In 2019, there were around 272 million international migrants.

The rate of voluntary return migration is likely to fall, except in the case of a few cross-border migration corridors in the South (such as Venezuela-Colombia, Nepal-India, Zimbabwe–South Africa, Myanmar-Thailand), it said.

Migrant workers tend to be vulnerable to the loss of employment and wages during an economic crisis in their host country, more so than native-born workers. Lockdowns in labour camps and dormitories can also increase the risk of contagion among migrant workers.

“Many migrants have been stranded due to the suspension of transport services. Some host countries have granted visa extensions and temporary amnesty to migrant workers, and some have suspended the involuntary return of migrants,” it said.

Observing that government policy responses to the COVID-19 crisis have largely excluded migrants and their families back home, the World Bank said there is a strong case for including migrants in the near-term health strategies of all countries, given the externalities associated with the health status of an entire population in the face of a highly contagious pandemic.

The Bank said governments would do well to consider short, medium and long-term interventions to support stranded migrants, remittance infrastructure, loss of subsistence income for families back home, and access to health, housing, education, and jobs for migrant workers in host/transit countries and their families back home.

The pandemic has also highlighted the global shortage of health professionals and an urgent need for global cooperation and long-term investments in medical training, it said."

The First Minister was speaking at her daily coronavirus briefing as the Scottish Government published a report pledging an easing of the lockdown measures will be ""conducted in a phased and careful manner"".

She stressed people will need to ""find a way to live with this virus"".

Ms Sturgeon said the number of people in Scotland who have died after testing positive for the virus is 1,120, up by 58 from 1,062 on Wednesday.

A total of 9,409 people have now tested positive, up by 371 from 9,038 the day before.

The number of people in intensive care and hospital in Scotland has fallen in the past 24 hours, by seven to 148 and by 28 to 1,776 respectively, which Ms Sturgeon said is a cause for ""real optimism"".

She said the key objective of the new paper is continuing to suppress the virus and the Scottish Government is ""increasingly confident"" measures put in place are helping to do this.

The First Minister said: ""As we start to lift the restrictions, the real risk is that Covid-19 runs rampant again.

""So a return to normal as we knew it is not on the cards in the near future and it's really important that I am upfront with you about that.

""What we must do is find a new normal, a way of living alongside this virus but in a form that keeps it under control and stops it taking the toll we know it can do.""

Ms Sturgeon said the reproduction rate of the virus must be kept below one, with best estimates putting the figures ""somewhere between 0.6 and one"".

She said lockdown measures are doing ""damage"" to Scotland, with problems in business, education and living standards, stressing a better ""balance"" will need to be found.

The paper is a ""first cut"", she said, designed to start an ""adult conversation"".

Ms Sturgeon added the ""science will never be exact"" and the Scottish Government will have to make judgments on any measures to be added or lifted.

The report makes clear ""living with the virus will mean continued uncertainty and changes to how we live our lives"".

It adds: ""The key consideration around easing restrictions is how to do so safely.

""Even as we lift some of the more restrictive measures, we are likely to require continued adherence to the advice on staying at home if symptomatic and to the advice on physical distancing.""

It is ""likely"" restrictions on gathering in groups, which have shut down pubs and led to public events across the country being cancelled, will need to continue ""for some time to come"", the report warns.

Good hand and cough hygiene ""must become fundamental habits"", it states, adding ""each one of us will have to adapt to this as the new normal, at least until we are sure that we can be more protected by a vaccine or treatment"".

The report states: ""Our assessment is that now is not the right time to relax restrictions.""

It adds: ""If, after easing any restrictions, the evidence tells us we are unable to contain the transmission of the virus then we will have to reimpose them, possibly returning to lockdown with little notice.

""While we will do our best to avoid this, it is possible that such a cycle may happen more than once until we reach a point when we have in place an effective vaccine.""

The report goes into more detailing, stating: ""Over the next few weeks, based on the evidence and expert advice, a number of options will be considered – not all of which may be selected.

""These are likely to include the easing of restrictions in a phased manner, opening up different parts of the economy sector by sector, considering different restrictions in different areas dependent on how the pandemic is progressing and considering options for different groups of the population – as is currently the case with those shielded for clinical reasons.

""It may be that restrictions on some outdoor activity are eased before those on indoor activities – however, all of this will be evidence-led.""

It adds: ""Easing restrictions will not mean returning to how things were before the virus.

""Physical distancing, hand hygiene, and other critical behaviours will be essential in each sector.""

Here the Scottish Government pledged to work with experts in different sectors ""to understand the practical consequences, for example, of what physical distancing would mean for schools and education, transport, business and recreation""."

Professor Tsiodras in his daily televised briefing said that “careless behaviour has led to a resurgence of outbreaks,” and urged for absolute diligence in observing all preventive and restrictive measures persistently, despite, as he said, the receding coronavirus pandemic.

He said that most of the new outbreaks since Wednesday were at two health clinics, where “vigilance was not observed by health practitioners who are more sensitive” to the health threats.

He also said that health experts have decided to recommend people wearing a fabric face mask, but only when using public transport or in “supermarkets and pharmacies,” while more specific instructions on the matter will be announced soon by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).

The professor also announced the daily statistics: 55 new confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Greece in the last 24 hours, and 4 new deaths. The Covid-19 infections total in Greece stands at 2,463.

Deaths stand at 125 since the start of the outbreak; 33 of them were women. Of the 125, 90.4% had underlying health issues or their average age was 70 years or more, with the average age of all the deceased was 74 years of age.

Most major film outlets rejected the premise — too divisive, too “problematic,” too much like “24” set in the occupied territories. It wasn’t until Israel’s yes Studios took a chance and called itself by its name that the sensation Jewish-American dads seem to love while younger, more politically liberal viewers love to hate-watch was green-lit.

In the immortal words of Chris Farley: “Why say no when it feels so good to say yes?” The third season, like the return of the wasteful son you didn’t know you wanted to embrace until he plopped himself back on your doorstep, has made its unlikely way back to us at the height of our lassitude.

Let us all say Baruch Hashem and Allahu Akhbar for that. Season three continues to unravel a story that is suspenseful, violent, complicated and, in many ways, a metaphor for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. On one hand, of course, there’s the intense Israeli desire to obliterate Hamas and vice versa. But also present is the more subtle, underlying dynamic of cultures that simultaneously seek to override their own programming while executing that which has been commanded. The human condition, its penchant for self-destruction and desire for order to be imposed from without, are on full display.

The characters here have the potential to coexist; desires to actually care about one another manifest themselves closer to the surface than before, but the struggle to find common ground … over common ground remains.

The use of Arabic and Hebrew rather than English as in some other recent international films creates an authenticity that outweighs the uncomfortable rapid-fire dialogue as it is translated into English subtitles.

As the season begins, Doron (Raz) and his team are once again trying to dismantle Hamas’ infrastructure, this time in Gaza (the first two seasons center on the West Bank). This time, he cleverly but also pretty unrealistically becomes a recruit of Hamas and becomes a respected boxing coach of an up-and-coming Palestinian fighter, Bashar. Of course, it’s not long before he’s found out and all manner of violence and killing ensues, picking right back up from seasons one and two.

Most interesting, in the process of being an imposter, Doron, now known as Abu Fadi, develops feeling for Bashar, a sense of loyalty. We’ve seen this play out before, with his love interest, the beautiful, French-speaking Dr. Shireen in seasons one and two.

Much of the season revolves around Doron trying to save Bashar’s life, after the pupil is thought to be a traitor who protected his coach, a Jew.

The violence is vivid and the photography is magnificent — whether that’s a selling point or a drawback may depend on your own level of sociopathy. The language is raw and real throughout with moments of sensitivity and compassion. Doron, for all his gruff bluster, conveys a deep feeling for Bashar, which is in keeping with what we’ve come to expect from the layered male lead.

The depth of hostility and hatred for both cultures is articulated by the complex use of technology and high-powered ammunition without any resolution to issues but sheer drama. We know it’s fiction, but an American Jew can’t help but wonder how much truth there is in the show’s portrayal.

While the show’s value as uncut pop entertainment can’t be denied, too often the overdone violence and killing is a huge disservice to all the nuance, superb acting, cinematography and incredible, realistic setting.

If you have seen seasons one and two, there’s no reason to stop now; there’s no reason now for much of anything, really. “Fauda” is rock-solid quarantine binging.

But if your stomach is a little weak or one potentially never-ending nightmare is already too much for you to take, maybe the new 10-part series on Michael Jordan’s Chicago Bulls is more your speed.

The study by Max Healthcare aims to collect sero-epidemiological data from 10,000 healthcare workers employed at various facilities owned by Max Healthcare and Radiant Lifecare, and study the effectiveness of HCQ as a prophylaxis for coronavirus infection, it said in a statement.

""The large-scale observational study will involve use of hydroxychloroquine prophylaxis among its healthcare workers, including those taking care of COVID-19 positive patients,"" it said.

The study will look at large amount of data from healthcare workers and try to establish a correlation between the use of HCQ prophylaxis and the incidence of COVID-19 among healthcare workers.

Based on the results of this study, Max Healthcare might decide to conduct a randomised control study of the HCQ prophylaxis, it said.

This is the first study involving COVID-19 that has been approved by ICMR. This is also the first study from India to be registered on http://clinicaltrials.gov, a global registry for clinical trials, the hospital group claimed.

''Since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the clinicians and scientists community have been in a race to research various aspects of this disease to explore possible prevention and treatment aspects. It is only clinical research that will help prevention of further spread of this disease.

""The main aim is to reach out to maximum number of healthcare workers, follow up on incidence of COVID in them and understand the disease pattern in relation to HCQ in COVID prevention,""said Dr Sujeet Jha,Principal Investigator, Principal Director, Endocrinology and Diabetes at Max Healthcare.

Abhay Soi, Chairman Max Healthcaresaid, ""We are hopeful that this will be our small but significant contribution in the global fight against COVID-19''.

The results of the study are likely to be published in another three weeks, it said."

Stuck at home for a whole term, it’s only natural that this’ll be multiplied by about 100. As we enter the strange new world of online supervisions, we need to be prepared to discover a new side to our supo partners – and ourselves. Luckily, I’ve compiled a list, so you’ll know exactly what to expect.

They think that being at home this term is a blessing in disguise, because they can spend more time with their pets. Paying attention to your supervisor is impossible when there is a cat walking in front of their camera. Taking notes is even more difficult, when said cat decides to attack a pen and you can see the whole fight. But what makes it all worthwhile is that they will probably introduce you to their pets during the supo, shortening the amount of time you actually have to focus on the work.

Key quote: “Yum yum Doritos let’s bake cookies for the fourth time this week!”

They’re probably done with life, and trying to kill time by eating away their feelings until they can go and be sad outside. You will hear a crunch in the background of the supo: this is the sound of munching and hopelessness.

The ‘I have no WiFi’ fraud

We all know that they live in Chelsea, buy M&S organic olives on a regular basis and went to boarding school: there is no way they don’t have WiFi at home. If you are this fraud, stop playing The Sims and leaving your supo partner stranded!

We all thought they had their shit together until they stood up. Nice top, bit weird that you’re wearing it with pyjama pants though. At least you’re wearing something… so, well done, I guess?

They work out every day during lockdown and are distraught that the supervision has interrupted their daily Youtube HIIT routine. Having discovered muscles they didn’t know existed, they feel ready to get a blue next year. They will probably immediately stop working out once they can actually go outside, forgetting about their newfound dreams rather quickly.

I’m not sure if they are actually winning at life or if I should be concerned. No one remembers their face. Do they even exist? Is life a simulation? Did Bush do 9-11? Answering the real questions to fill the void they feel inside.

They walk in looking like a hermit while trying to find nail polish they haven’t seen since 1997. You will forever remember the look of fear in everyone’s eyes once they notice this unexpected visitor.

They are thriving in lockdown and have already finished revising for exams. They have also written a best-selling novel, started developing a coronavirus vaccine, and also managed to find the time to do their makeup every day. Probably having an internal breakdown, but they’re hiding it very well behind red lipstick.

The one who really misses uni

They will wear stash in every supervision and will seem overly excited to see you. Their Instagram feed during the next six months will exclusively contain posts captioned #tbt. Maybe check on them a bit more often?

Zoom doesn’t like them and neither does Skype. You haven’t heard their voice in 10 minutes but are too scared to say anything. They are trying their hardest and probably need a hug."

The strong man from Pyongyang responded to a letter from Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. For the US military, Kim is still in charge. The North Korean regime continues to deny coronavirus cases in the country.

Pyongyang (AsiaNews / Agencies) - North Korean leader Kim Jong-un is showing signs of life after some press reports had rumored he was dying. Yesterday, the regime's KCNA news agency revealed that the strong man from Pyongyang responded to a letter from Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. In recent days, the Damascus leader had congratulated Kim on the 108th anniversary of the birth of his grandfather Kim Il-sung, the founder of North Korea.

CNN, citing an anonymous source within the United States government, reported on April 20 that Kim was in ""serious danger"" after a surgical operation. The news first emerged in an article in the Daily NK, according to which the leader of Pyongyang underwent cardiovascular surgery on April 12th.

Kim has not appeared in public since April 11, when he chaired a high-level meeting of the Workers' Party, which has ruled North Korea since the end of World War II.

The South Korean government has denied that Kim has serious health problems. At first, the Trump administration said it had no information on the matter. Yesterday, however, General John Hyten, deputy chief of the US joint staff, said that Kim is in full control of the armed forces.

Rumors of Kim's condition arrive in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic. Amid the skepticism of external observers, Pyongyang continues to argue that there are no cases of contagion in the country. Daily NK, which is based in Seoul and is linked to the South Korean Unification Ministry, writes that a North Korean citizen, who tested positive for Covid-19, is being quarantined in a hospital in the Chinese province of Jilin. On April 20, while trying to cross the border, the man was stopped by Chinese border guards.

Meanwhile, South Korean aid groups have received the go-ahead from the Seoul government to send medical supplies to the North. These are protections (gloves, clothes and masks) to fight lung infection."

These patented XAI models allow banks to accelerate digital onboarding, conduct eligibility checks and process loan applications for SMEs and retail customers. The models are available as part of the Temenos AI portfolio or can be integrated with Temenos Infinity, the leading digital omnichannel product, and are delivered as Temenos SaaS for fast and scalable deployment.

Max Chuard, Chief Executive Officer, Temenos, said: ""These are challenging times for small businesses in particular. As the leader in banking software, Temenos is committed to innovation that not only keeps banks and the global economy running, but also helps SMEs and retail customers access funding at a time of financial distress. We are delivering our cloud-native, advanced AI banking software as SaaS to enable banks qualify and process loans rapidly. I am proud that with our technology we can provide banks with a modern digital banking platform and decision-making capabilities, allowing them to move incredibly fast and compress projects that would usually take months into days.""

Temenos' XAI models help banks make urgent lending decisions that are transparent and explainable in human language to the end-users, customers and the regulators. These models enable banks to identify appropriate products that carry an acceptable level of risk for both the customer and the bank. The SME model, in particular, provides on average over 25% greater accuracy compared to the risk score provided by leading credit bureaus, allowing banks to increase their pass rate by 20% while keeping defaults under control.

The new XAI models enable banks to take into account a wide range of variables when making lending decisions, such as additional incomes, new cost reductions, and alternative forms of collateral. Temenos XAI models can instantly calculate the impact of new variables and suggest additional terms and conditions.

As a result of the pandemic, banks are being asked to lend in unusual circumstances, requiring them to manage the twin pressures of increasing arrears and political pressure not to trigger defaults. Government Initiatives like the UK Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CBILS) and the US Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) are aiming to help SMEs in need of financial support by promoting emergency bank loans.

Jerry Silva, Research Vice President, IDC, said: ""A record number of small businesses and individuals are now applying for loans and financial relief. In the face of this demand, banks need to respond by providing digital self-service user journeys, quickly conducting eligibility checks, adhering to bank risk criteria, and establishing appropriate pricing. Solutions like Temenos' new XAI models are designed to help banks accelerate the loan application process by centralizing and enforcing policy rules using AI to ensure decisions are based on bank-specified criteria while maintaining transparency with customers and maintaining compliance and risk controls.""

These API-driven XAI models can be rolled out with the associated policy rules, allowing smart decision-making with minimal integration that can be deployed in the cloud in days or just a few weeks. This consistency in decision-making helps frontline staff by reducing the need for manual intervention, which can slow the processing of the huge volumes of applications being considered. Temenos' XAI models can be used by any business user with minimum reliance on the IT department.
• Temenos AI SME Smart Decisioning: Temenos provides centrally created support for decision makers at the front line, for on-boarding, edibility checks and rapid loan processing. Furthermore, it reduces the need for human intervention in underwriting departments. The model is already proven with blue-chip UK lenders and can rapidly augment the decision-making processes already in place.
• Temenos AI Loan Pre-Approvals: Lending pre-approval for all customers. Expedite short- term urgent lending to the greatest number of customers.

Temenos AG (SIX: TEMN) is the world's leader in banking software. Over 3,000 banks across the globe, including 41 of the top 50 banks, rely on Temenos to process both the daily transactions and client interactions of more than 500 million banking customers. Temenos offers cloud-native, cloud-agnostic and AI-driven front office, core banking, payments and fund administration software enabling banks to deliver frictionless, omnichannel customer experiences and gain operational excellence.

Temenos software is proven to enable its top-performing clients to achieve cost-income ratios of 26.8% half the industry average and returns on equity of 29%, three times the industry average. These clients also invest 51% of their IT budget on growth and innovation versus maintenance, which is double the industry average, proving the banks' IT investment is adding tangible value to their business."

The company on Wednesday said it lost $435 million in the first three months of 2020, a year after it posted a $28.6 million loss. It reported revenue of $446 million, down 37 perecent from the $704 million in revenue it received in the first quarter of 2019.

Patterson-UTI, like other companies in the industry, said the loss was a result of reducing the value of assets by $406 million as oil prices collapsed during the quarter. The company has 123 drilling rigs in the field, but CEO Andy Hendricks, says he expects customers to cut activity in the wake of the unprecedented fall of the U.S. oil price into negative territory.

""The rig count is coming down fairly quickly still,"" Hendricks said Wesdnesday. ""We'll probably exit the second quarter somewhere just above 70 rigs or close to 70 rigs. Overall, this is going to be a rapid downturn. Our overall activity, and that's activity in the industry — not just us — is going to be coming down 60 percent or more.""

Expert: Oil could go to negative $100 per barrel in May

Exploration and production companies have been slashing spending for months as the world's demand for crude oil disappeared during the coronavirus pandemic.

In response, Patterson-UTI has cut costs, shut down some offices, consolidated operations and eliminated a layer of management. The company also halved its quarterly dividend to 2 cents per share.

Considered to be critical infrastructure by the federal government, Patterson-UTI's drilling rigs and crews are allowed to continue operating in the oil fields.

549,549,https://www.thebeijinger.com/blog/2020/04/23/throwback-thursday-when-boris-johnson-flubbed-weibo,Throwback Thursday: When Boris Johnson Flubbed Weibo,"Eight years ago this month, the future prime minister of the UK logged onto Weibo for the first time.",www.thebeijinger.com,"Throwback Thursday takes a look back into Beijing's past, using our 12-year-strong blog archives as the source for a glance at the weird and wonderful stories of Beijing's days gone by.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is often compared to that other blond, crazy-haired world leader with a jarringly improvisational speaking style, but the similarities between the two are limited. For example, Donald Trump had already ""mastered"" social media by 2012, while Johnson’s bumbling entrance to Weibo showed that he was a relative late-comer when it came to cutting his microblogging chops.

As our blog reported eight years ago this month, Johnson, then mayor of London, logged onto Weibo with the account @BorisJohnson in what British commenters called a move to “woo Chinese voters in London.” They were likely correct, given that Ken Livingstone, the opposing mayoral candidate, registered an account ten days later.

But like his visit to Beijing during the Olympics, Johnson’s initial posts were not particularly well-received by netizens. In his 2008 visit, the mayor had invited criticism from Chinese bloggers due to his now world-famous casual attitude. The problem on Weibo, at least at first, was that he was posting in English.

""I can’t understand this sentence,"" wrote one commenter in an English response. Another highly upvoted comment read in Chinese, ""Old man~ Can you speak a little Chinese? We are Chinese people, we are on Chinese soil.""

But using English wasn’t the only misstep. Johnson also failed to use Weibo’s double-ended hashtag (writing the unclickable #BackBoris instead of #BackBoris#), and more egregiously, somehow managed to copy-paste irrelevant replies from his Twitter account to Weibo, effectively littering his own page with nonsense.

Soon afterward, Johnson’s team finally got a grasp on Weibo, and after he won re-election, the account even started translating his posts into Chinese in preparation for his next visit to Beijing. He answered netizen’s questions in Chinese, like what his favorite British food was (lamb curry), who his favorite James Bond actor was (Christopher Lee, because he had met him recently), and how to deal with traffic congestion (build more railways).

But the mayor apparently lost interest in Weibo following his 2013 visit to China. After uploading a few pictures from the trip, the account never posted again. Johnson apparently forgot the password as well, because when he reappeared on the site this year to share a video of himself talking about how he somehow contracted COVID-19 (from which he has since recovered), it was via a new account, once again in English, and embarrassingly handled @realBorisJohnson."
550,550,https://www.southernstandard.com/tennessee-covid-19-updates/va-medical-facilities/,VA medical facilities struggle to cope with the coronavirus,"BOSTON (AP) — As she treated patient after patient infected with the coronavirus at a Veterans Affairs medical center in New York City, Heather Espinal saw stark warning signs.",www.southernstandard.com,"By MICHAEL CASEY and HOPE YEN Associated Press

BOSTON (AP) — As she treated patient after patient infected with the coronavirus at a Veterans Affairs medical center in New York City, Heather Espinal saw stark warning signs.

So many nurses had called in sick, she said, that the Bronx facility was woefully understaffed. It lacked specially equipped rooms for infected patients, she said, and didn't have enough masks, gloves and other protective gear to guard against the spread of the highly contagious disease.

Espinal, a member of the union National Nurses United, says she and her colleagues were told to do the best they could, using a single N95 face mask for an entire shift rather than getting a new one for each patient. In early April, she tested positive for COVID-19.

""I definitely believe it was related to me being at work,"" said the 34-year-old Espinal, who was out sick for two weeks.

Espinal is one of 1,900 VA health care workers who have become sick with the coronavirus, according to agency documents obtained by The Associated Press. Twenty have died. Another 3,600 of the 300,000-plus VA health care employees are quarantined and unable to work because they have been exposed to the virus, according to VA figures.

As the coronavirus spreads across the U.S., VA health care facilities are struggling with shortages of workers and the equipment necessary to protect employees from contracting the virus, according to VA staff and internal documents obtained by the AP.

""We thought we were doing everything right, even with reusing these N95 respirators. But we still ended up getting sick,"" Espinal said.

More than 5,700 veterans treated by the VA have been infected by the coronavirus, and nearly 380 have died.

The Labor Department is now investigating, and several Democrats in Congress sent a letter Thursday calling on President Donald Trump to invoke the Defense Production Act to get more supplies for VA health facilities.

The VA, responsible for the health care of 9 million military veterans, denied it was short of supplies and stressed that it follows federal health guidelines when rationing personal protective equipment like masks and gloves.

""VA's PPE conservation posture is precisely why the department has not encountered any PPE shortages that have negatively impacted patient care or employee safety,"" said spokeswoman Christina Mandreucci. She said the VA has moved aggressively in recent weeks to add staff, hiring 3,183 people, including 981 nurses, from March 29 to April 11.

But interviews with VA employees at facilities around the country, internal documents, and a March report by the agency's inspector general tell another story.

The facilities were short of staff and equipment like masks, eye shields, hand sanitizer and gowns. Some workers were forced to reuse masks for days or weeks, according to interviews with VA nurses. In hard-hit states like New York, a crush of coronavirus patients led to a shortage of negative pressure rooms to limit the spread of the virus, several VA nurses told the AP.

The VA inspector general's staff visited more than 230 facilities in March. It found that nearly a third of the medical centers could improve their processing for screening visitors. More than half of the medical centers reported shortages of supplies and equipment including respirator masks, and 10 reported shortages of staffing mostly for nurses in intensive care units.

""There has been a failure of leadership at VA, and veterans, VA employees and the public are suffering as a result,"" said Paul Rieckhoff, founder and former head of the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America and now host of the podcast ""Angry Americans.""

Suzanne Gordon, a senior policy analyst at the nonpartisan Veterans Healthcare Policy Institute, said VA preparations were hampered by inadequate funding and staff, leaving it with nearly 50,000 job openings.

""In VA facilities all over the country, they are doing a really incredible job trying to respond to the crisis in a situation where they have been deliberately crippled by the Trump administration,"" Gordon said.

As the nation's largest health care system, the VA typically enjoyed preferred status in orders for medical supplies from prime vendors.

But as the outbreak escalated in the U.S., surging demand for crucial medical equipment spurred frantic competition for supplies, including from state governments and the National Stockpile. The Federal Emergency Management Agency began buying supplies directly from manufacturers, and VA began submitting its orders to FEMA alongside others.

Not long after, according to people familiar with VA's weekly briefings to Congress, the supply shortages got worse as medical workers burned through 250,000 masks a day.

On April 7, the VA issued guidelines asking workers to ration masks in response to what the department described as ""shortages"" and challenges in getting ""adequate supplies"" to protect VA staff, according to an internal memo. Citing Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, the VA said employees in direct contact with COVID-19 patients should use N95 masks as protection but may need to reuse them. VA staff working with high-risk elderly or vulnerable patients, such as those in nursing homes or spinal cord facilities, would only get one face mask per work week.

After criticism from staff, and a small increase in supplies, the VA on April 16 said those employees working with high-risk elderly or vulnerable veterans could now have one face mask per day.

Individual medical centers have wide discretion if they face shortages, including allowing employees in direct contact with COVID patients to use surgical masks instead of N95 respirators and permitting staff to bring their own.

All other VA staff would be encouraged to bring in handmade masks, even if they work in a building where the disease is present.

A complaint filed by the American Federation of Government Employees alleges that VA workers who came in contact with someone suspected of contracting the virus were told on orders of VA Secretary Robert Wilkie that they still had to report to work — ignoring a 14-day quarantine period. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration is investigating.

The staff and equipment shortages are creating chaos at the VA medical center in Brooklyn, New York, according to Maria Lobifaro, an intensive care nurse.

""Usually the ratio is one nurse to two critical patients. I'm having five critical ICU patients on ventilators,"" said Lobifaro, who also is a member of National Nurses United, which has organized protests as VA facilities in Brooklyn and Baltimore.

""This has happened four times in the last week and a half. It's to the point where ... my hands are trembling because of what I'm going to walk into,"" she continued. ""I've never seen anything like this.""

A group of Senate Democrats blames Trump for a ""broken procurement and distribution system developed by this administration.""

""Those who care for veterans should not be afraid to wake up every morning, go to work and help save veterans' lives,"" says a letter sent to the White House on Thursday by Sen. Jon Tester of Montana, the top Democrat on the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee. More than a dozen senators joined him, including Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Kamala Harris of California, all former 2020 presidential contenders.

""We have the lowest employee infection rate in the world. It is less than half of 1 percent,"" he said Wednesday on MSNBC, citing higher rates in Italy and elsewhere in the U.S.

Irma Westmoreland, a nurse at the Charlie Norwood VA in Augusta, Georgia, said it's hard for nurses to be tested, so no one really knows how bad the situation is.

""We are told if you have symptoms or feel like you have been exposed and you want to be tested unless you are veteran, you can't be tested,"" said Westmoreland, another NNU member, adding that employees are told go to their own doctors if they want to be tested.

""It's stressful for the nurses to be in this environment,"" she said. ""But it's even more stressful when they don't have information they need."""

Most equity markets in the Asia Pacific region rose, with the notable exceptions of China and Australia.",www.fxempire.com,"The flash PMI readings were worse than expected. The broad story is the same, nearly everywhere. Manufacturing fell while service activity imploded. The composites reflect the importance of the latter. German manufacturing PMI fell from 45.4 to 34.4. France’s fell to 31.5 from 43.2. The service PMI fell to 15.9 in German (from 31.7) and to 10.4 in France (from 27.4).

The composite reading was halved in Germany to 17.1 (from 35.0) and even more in France (11.2 from 28.9). The composite reading for the eurozone as a whole stands at 13.5, down from 29.7. The UK’s reading was similar. The manufacturing PMI is at 32.9 from 47.8. The service PMI fell to 12.3 from 34.5, while the composite stands at 12.9 (down from 36.0).

Ahead of next week’s meeting, the ECB announced yesterday that it would accept as collateral bonds that had been rated investment grade before April 7. The concern is that in the period ahead, some companies, and perhaps some sovereigns, may lose their investment-grade status, which would further disrupt the ECB’s transmission mechanism by adversely impacting the ability of banks to borrow from the ECB.

The Federal Reserve indicated that it would buy some bonds that recently lost their investment-grade ratings. The ECB has not indicated it would purchase such instruments, but it did leave the door open for a future move. S&P announces the results of its review of Italian debt tomorrow. It is expected to cut it by one notch, which would leave it at its lowest investment grade reading. Recall, the ECB takes the highest rating of the top four agencies (including DBRS).

The EU leaders meet today to find an agreement on a larger assistance package. The size and modalities are not clear. Two things seem likely. First, a compromise will be on the EU level, not the eurozone. Second, a substantially larger budget and an EU debt instrument look likely. The European project, as it were, is shaped by its responses to crises, and although many argued that it was mutualization of debt or bust, a compromise that falls shy of it, is likely.

The euro has been sold below $1.08 for the first time in a couple of weeks today. It has tested the month’s low near $1.0770. Last month’s low was near $1.0635. There are large options that expire today that may influence the price action. There are 3.2 bln euro in options between $1.0800 and $1.0810 and an option for 525 mln euros at $1.0790.

There is a billion-euro option at $1.0750. On the upside, there is a two-billion euro in options struck in the $1.0830-$1.0840 area. The intraday technicals are overextended for the euro as the North American session is about to start. Sterling is trading quietly inside yesterday’s range, which was inside Tuesday’s range. It has spent most of the past 24-hours between $1.2300 and $1.2360. It finished last week near $1.25.

The US sees the preliminary April PMI, March new homes sales, and the April Kansas Fed’s manufacturing survey, but it will be the weekly jobless claims that command the most attention. It is the closest thing to a real-time economic snapshot. The Good Friday holiday may have dampened the number of people filing for unemployment benefits for the first time. The median forecast in the Bloomberg survey is for a 4.5 mln jump. Ideas that the backlog from some states are being absorbed has fanned talk of another reading above 5 mln. Separately, the House of Representatives is expected to approve the new spending bill (~$485 bln) that replenishes the funds for the Payroll Protection Plan. The bill is expected to pass before midday. Another bill that provides state and local governments money will be on next month’s agenda.

The US dollar gained about 1.45% against the Canadian dollar during the first two sessions this week and pared those gains yesterday and is slightly heavier today as well. Initial support is seen a little above CAD1.4100. Resistance is seen in the CAD1.4235-CAD1.4265 area. Firmer equities and oil favor the Loonie.

The US dollar settled last week a little below MXN23.70 and has risen in the first three sessions this week. The greenback is firm near MXN24.50 after having earlier approached yesterday’s high near MXN24.69. Mexico reported over 1000 new virus cases yesterday for the first time as the contagion looks to be spreading quickly. The IMF says Mexico has committed among the least resources to combat the economic and financial consequences even though it estimates Mexico’s economy will be among the hardest hit."

The mum-of-two, who played the feisty Lauren Branning from 2010 to 2018, has spoken out about just how keen she is for her character to make a return to Albert Square.

Lauren left Walford alongside husband Peter Beale after her sister Abi died falling off the roof of the Queen Vic pub.

Peter returned to his East London stomping ground earlier this year, revealing that Lauren is living in New Zealand.

Of course, Peter’s reappearance sparked hope among soap fans that Lauren would do the same.

Now, Jacqueline has hinted that she could be taking on her old role within the next few years.

“I absolutely love EastEnders, love the people, the production and I absolutely love Lauren Branning with all my heart,” the I’m A Celebrity…Get Me Out Of Here winner told the Daily Mail.

“It doesn’t feel like it was a goodbye forever, definitely not, well not from my end anyway. I would love to go back someday.

“When asked if she would return in under five years, admitted, “I think that sounds better than me going back tomorrow, yes.”

Lauren recently paid a sweet tribute to her soap career in a sweet Instagram post.

Reminiscing on her time playing Lauren, Jacqueline shared a series of photos from her EastEnders days, writing, ‘I had such an amazing time and LOVED Lauren Branning with ALL of my heart! I miss you lozza, maybe see you again one day! Amazing week of eps congrats everyone involved! Some pics of my time on the show! Wow. Memories🖤.’

Plenty of Lauren Branning fans took to the comment section to beg Jacqueline to make a return to screens.

‘I stopped watching it when you left😩need you back!!!❤️❤️❤️,’ agreed another."

How the format has shifted this year and what it means for high school students hoping to earn some college credit.,www.ktuu.com,"Schools all over the nation are closed down because of the COVID-19 pandemic, but that doesn't mean class is dismissed. It does, however, change things, including the way testing will be administered for advanced placement students here in Alaska.

Instead of a grueling three-hour examination with multiple choice questions and multiple essays to write things are being condensed.

""This year they will be taking a 45 minutes at home exam regardless of the content area... Essentially everything is super-condensed all the multiple-choice components have been taken out of the picture and they will be doing it on a screen for the first time. So those are some of the primary differences,"" says Valerie Baalerud, AP coordinator for the Anchorage School District.

Less testing may sound like a win for those who will be taking the exams, but students seem to have differing opinions about the effect the new format will have.

Eagle River high school sophomore Gavin Taylor sees it as a plus.

""Cutting down to a fraction of that is a little easier for me rather than maybe someone who has been studying for a three-hour-long exam, so there's definitely pitfalls but it's a little easier.""

Meanwhile, school valedictorian Devin Higgins has some concerns.

""I think the AP test is probably gonna be a little harder for people to pass or at least get really good scores on since it's shorter and there's only one thing you have to do for each test. It kind of makes it harder because if it's like a question that includes concepts they aren't familiar with you don't have much to fall back on if you screw it up.""

Easier, harder, that may depend on one's point of view and study habits.

The important news is that these tests are going forward and these students will have an opportunity to earn some college credit.

""I think that what they did was to kind of survey students around the nation and say, is this something you still want to go ahead with and overwhelmingly students and teachers said yes you know we worked all year we want to have the opportunity to take those exams to demonstrate proficiency to colleges and to potentially earn college credit,"" says Ms. Baalerud.

Students still have a bit more time to study, testing begins May 11th and will run for about two weeks as each subject is covered. Though these will be shortened exams Ms. Baalerud says that the grand majority of colleges and universities will still count them for the same amount of credit as the traditional longer AP tests. So while it will be augmented, it won't be something that students miss out on, making it a rarity for high school kids in the year 2020."

White onion mashed with cilantro and serrano chilies add the right amount of bite, while chopped grape tomatoes offer balanced acidity against the rich avocados. Mashing the cilantro, chilies, and onion in the same bowl as the avocados keeps their flavors in the food, not on the cutting board.

Guacamole hinges on the ripeness of the avocados; they should be soft but slightly firm.

In a bowl, combine 2 tablespoons of the cilantro, the chilies, onion, and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Mash with the bottom of a dry measuring cup until a rough paste forms, about one minute.

Scoop the avocado flesh into the bowl and coarsely mash with a potato masher or fork. Stir in half of the tomatoes until combined. Taste and season with salt.

Transfer to a serving bowl and sprinkle with the remaining cilantro and tomatoes.

Shaked has made it clear that Yamina is seriously preparing for the possibility of remaining outside the developing government. ""If Netanyahu decides to dismantle the bloc we will be a fighting opposition. Support for sovereignty is possible from the outside as well.""

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the Likud negotiating team convened a video conference Wednesday evening with Yamina Chairman Defense Minister Naftali Bennett and his representative Tal Gan-Zvi.

According to Kan, during the meeting the Prime Minister offered the party the Housing portfolio for the whole term and the Foreign Affairs portfolio for the second half of it. In addition, the Jerusalem Affairs portfolio was offered to the party.

Though not stated explicitly in the discussion, Yamina was dissatisfied with the proposal and demands at least one other deputy minister and a significant committee head - possibly the Constitution Committee.

The two parties, Likud and Yamina, issued a joint statement at the end of the meeting saying, ""The meeting was positive. It was agreed that a follow-up meeting would be scheduled."""

Ganguly died at her residence in south Kolkata on Thursday.

Ganguly, 75, was found motionless at her flat in the Lake Gardens area of the city by her maid around 7 am, her family said.

A doctor was called in who declared that she died of a massive cardiac attack a few minutes earlier, they said.

Ganguly is survived by a son but lived alone in her flat. Her husband Kamalendu died some years back.

She founded the Rangakarmee group in 1976, which is known for non-conformist productions like Mahabhoj, Rudali, Court Martial and Antaryatra.

Ganguly, who is credited for introducing a new form of alternative Hindi theatre in Bengal, used to say ""theatre is my only life and passion and Rangkarmee is my family"", her friends recalled.

Her Rangakarmee gave a separate idiom, a new language to theatre in Bengal and created a new audience, which had so far been familiar with Bengali group theatre and English theatre, in the late 70s and 80s.

Besides late thespian Shyamanand Jalan who was the founder of Padatik, Ganguly is credited to have ushered in the rich, glorious tradition of Hindi theatre in Kolkata having both Bengali and non-Bengali speaking audiences.

Her Bengali productions include Mukti and Manasi. She also worked with Rituparno Ghosh during the scripting for Raincoat.

Recalling Ganguly's contribution to theatre, she said the state government had conferred her with the 'Girish Samman' honour in 2016.

""My deep condolences to her family and friends and followers,"" the chief minister said in a statement in Bengali 



She was awarded the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award for direction in 1998 and also honoured by the West Bengal government as the 'Best Actress' for the play 'Gudia Ghar'.

Born in Jodhpur in a family originally hailing from Uttar Pradesh, Ganguly had shown her prowess in performing arts at a young age, learning Bharatanatyam.

She later moved to Kolkata and studied Hindi literature.

Director Aparna Sen, theatre personality Sohag Sen, director Sudeshna Roy and many other artistes from the theatre and film fraternity expressed shock over her death.

""I can't believe she is no more,"" Aparna Sen said.

Her last rites were performed in the presence of her family and members of Rangakarmee at the Keoratala crematorium."

559,559,https://clutchpoints.com/saints-not-afraid-about-drafting-qb/,Saints 'Not Afraid' About Drafting QB,"The Saints are set at quarterback with star Drew Brees under center, but a new report indicates they could draft Brees' successor this year.",clutchpoints.com,"There is some uncertainty surrounding what the New Orleans Saints plan on doing in the 2020 NFL Draft. Among the choices they could make, New Orleans is “not afraid” to select a quarterback in the first round.

“I think that any time you have a chance to get a quality quarterback prospect, regardless of your quarterback situation, you’d like to take advantage of that,” Loomis said, via the team’s website. “For us, it hasn’t come. There hasn’t been the match where we’re picking with a prospect that we really like. Our approach is exactly the same this year: If there’s someone there that we really like and have a vision for at the time we’re picking, then we’re not afraid to pull that trigger.”

Despite re-signing Drew Brees this offseason, the Saints understand that they need to begin looking toward the future. Even though they’ve shown confidence in Taysom Hill to be the heir apparent to Brees, New Orleans could add another quarterback to the roster.

In all likelihood, the Saints aren’t going to have a shot at Joe Burrow, Tua Tagovailoa, or Justin Herbert. However, they could become interested in possibly taking Utah State’s Jordan Love in the first round.

On the other hand, they could target someone like Mason Fine in the later rounds. Fine spoke to New Orleans in the pre-draft process and was seen working out with Brees earlier this offseason.

Regardless of their current quarterback situation, the Saints realize that having multiple starters can be a valuable asset to have. While some fans clamor for New Orleans to build around Brees, they could be drafting someone that plays the same position as him in the NFL Draft."

Spotting Skin Cancer Early Can Save Your Life,"Winter Haven, FL (PRWEB) April 23, 2020 --  Summer: it’s a recipe for spending more time outdoors. Depending on your activities, all that extra time in the sun",www.prweb.com,"Summer: it’s a recipe for spending more time outdoors. Depending on your activities, all that extra time in the sun is sure to leave you with harmful exposure to ultraviolet (UV) rays if you aren’t using proper sun protection. Did you know more than five million new cases of skin cancer are diagnosed each year? And of those, roughly 85 percent of melanoma cases are associated with exposure to UV radiation from the sun.

Skin cancer is the most common form of cancer in the United States. Every year, skin cancer diagnoses outnumber new cases of many other types of cancers such as breast, colon, lung, and prostate.

“Anyone can get skin cancer. Regardless of skin color or background,” says Medical Director of Florida Dermatology and Skin Cancer Centers, Dr. K. Wade Foster. “Fortunately, skin cancer is one of the most preventable forms of cancer and we can lessen our chances by taking a few important measures.”

So, what can we do to help protect ourselves from a diagnosis?

Check yourself: Florida Dermatology and Skin Cancer Centers recommends that you regularly perform a self-exam by checking yourself in the mirror and looking for any new, unusual or changing areas, and reporting those to your dermatologist right away. An annual skin exam can also help identify suspicious growths, moles, and other dermatological changes. Areas of the skin that are exposed to the sun are more prone to develop moles or certain growths, and because of this, it’s very important to have an experienced dermatologist or licensed medical professional conduct a yearly body analysis to check all areas of your body, including your scalp, neck, and back.

What should you look for?

Florida Dermatology and Skin Cancer Centers (FLDSCC), along with The American Academy of Dermatology recommends conducting annual skin exams to look for the ABCDE’s of skin cancer. A is for Asymmetry: One half of the mole looks different from the other half. B is for Border: The mole has an irregular or poorly defined border. C is for Color: The mole’s color varies from one area to the next, and may include shades of tan, brown or black, or areas of white, red, or blue. D is for Diameter: May be greater than six millimeters, or about the size of a pencil eraser, and can be smaller when diagnosed. E is for Evolving: The mole or lesion is changing in size, shape, or color over time.

Wear sunscreen: Liberally apply sunscreen to all exposed areas of your skin when going outdoors. It’s important to read the label of your sunscreen to make certain it is water-resistant and broad-spectrum with an SPF of 30 or higher. If you are sweating or swimming, you’ll need to reapply every two hours.

Cover up: Sunscreen is only one part of protecting yourself from the sun’s powerful UV rays. In addition to using it, you should wear protective clothing to guarantee extra coverage. Fortunately, lots of companies make long-sleeved and lightweight shirts, pants, hats and sunglasses with UV protection built in. Make use of these especially when around reflective surfaces like the sand, water, and snow. And when you can, during the hours of 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., try to stay under shaded areas since the sun’s UV rays are strongest during that time frame.

Avoid tanning beds: Researchers estimate that indoor tanning may cause upwards of 400,000 cases of skin cancer in the United States each year. Luckily there are alternatives to achieving a sun-kissed glow without UV rays with the use of sunless tanning lotions and spray tanning.

Are you in the know?
• More than two people die of skin cancer every hour.
• If you’ve had more than five sunburns, your risk of melanoma has doubled.
• Melanoma is the second most common form of cancer in females ages 15-29 and is increasing faster in females in this age group than in males of the same age group.
• It is estimated that melanoma will affect 1 in 27 men and 1 in 40 women in their lifetime.
• The five-year survival rate for people whose melanoma is detected and treated is 99 percent.

In the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, not all has been good in McMahon’s life, starting with the shutting down of XFL, a professional American football league owned by McMahon's Alpha Entertainment. That was followed by the illegal termination lawsuit he received from XFL commissioner Oliver Luck.

Luck has claimed that he was illegitimately sacked on April 9 – a day before XFL officially collapsed. USA Today Sports earlier reported that the lawsuit states ""Mr. Luck wholly disputes and rejects the allegations set forth in the Termination Letter and contend they are pretextual and devoid of merit.”

During PW Insider Elite Audio, Mike Johnson has disclosed that McMahon’s bad moods have turned into a joke in the company.

“A couple of weeks ago, Vince McMahon was a grumpy SOB because of the XFL going down and I got calls from people who knew — there were people who were like, ‘Yeah, I’m gonna stay out of the building for as long as I can and sit in my car or take the widest path that I can to stay out of his way and stay out of his vision'.""

“It’s a running joke in the company, you know it’s great to do well in WWE and it’s great to get a raise and a promotion, but the raise and promotion you don’t wanna get is the one that’s gonna put you in the direct sight of Vince McMahon,” Johnson further added, as reported by Ringside News.

The XFL, comprising eight teams equally divided between an East and West division, was founded in 2018 and the first season had kick-started earlier this year. This tournament is the successor of the original XFL, which was owned by McMahon’s World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) and NBC and ran for just one season in 2001."

564,564,https://mynorthwest.com/1830262/inslee-no-bite-coronavirus-stay-home-order/,"Rantz: Gov. Inslee is all bark, no bite on coronavirus stay-at-home order",Voices critical of Governor Jay Inslee's coronavirus stay-at-home order are growing louder. It appears he barely has a plan to get our economy back.,mynorthwest.com,"Voices critical of Governor Jay Inslee’s coronavirus stay-at-home order are growing louder and louder.

Sheriffs refuse to enforce, Republican lawmakers are getting tired of being left in the dark, and every day Washingtonians wonder if Inslee even understands their hardships.

All of this could have been avoided if Inslee was a competent, consistent leader. But Inslee’s coronavirus leadership is playing out like his presidential campaign. It started with signs of promise, but only 17 seconds after it started we realize he doesn’t quite understand what he’s doing.

When Snohomish County Sheriff Adam Fortney posted a long condemnation of Inslee to his Facebook page, it went viral almost instantly. Why? Because he voiced what many Washingtonians — from Sultan to Sequim and Everett to Eatonville — are all feeling.

“I just watched the Governor’s speech to Washingtonian’s regarding our approach to getting Washington back in business and I am left to wonder if he even has a plan?” Fortney wrote. “To be quite honest I wasn’t even sure what he was trying to say half of the time. He has no plan. He has no details. This simply is not good enough in times when we have taken such drastic measures as the suspension of constitutional rights.”

Except this doesn’t really mean anything. He can threaten to put Attorney General Bob Ferguson on the case if he’d like, but the truth is, Inslee hasn’t even ordered law enforcement agencies to enforce his orders.

Fortney, weeks ago, said he wouldn’t enforce the stay-at-home order. So, too, did King County Sheriff Mitzi Johanknecht on the Jason Rantz Show insisting she’d only get involved in limited circumstances if Public Health made a legitimate ask. In Bellevue, even though they have an app to report instances of people not abiding by the coronavirus stay-at-home order, the police department acknowledges they don’t hand out tickets or make arrests.

What’s more, thousands of protesters took to Olympia, in violation of his order. Were they arrested, fined, or even asked to leave? When boaters fished in Richland, in violation of the order, what were the consequences? None.

Inslee isn’t enforcing his own coronavirus stay-at-home order, and I suspect he knows there are portions to it that are legally untenable.

Under the coronavirus stay-at-home order, you can get an elective abortion, but not buy a gun at a gun shop. You can buy weed to unwind from coronavirus stresses, but you can’t fish alone in a boat to de-stress. You can work a construction job on a publicly funded project, but a privately funded one? You’re out of luck.

These inconsistencies, motivated more by politics than public safety, likely plays a role in why Inslee won’t enforce his order. How can you legally argue closing down a private construction site of a handful of people will imminently spread the coronavirus, but a large publicly funded construction project doesn’t? You can’t. He doesn’t want to make that argument in front of a court, even in progressive-friendly Washington state.

And people are noticing. It’s why some folks are openly defying his orders. It’s why some gun shops aren’t closing down and why groups are playing soccer in parks. Inslee is being exposed at the worst possible time: people are hurting, needing to go back to work, and they’re growing more listless.

He has a map, drawn with a thick crayon on the back of a kid’s menu, but no compass to get him where he needs to go. He knows we need to re-open the economy, but he doesn’t quite know how and fails to clearly articulate how we’ll get there.

The Tuesday night speech, touted as a glimpse at his plan, was vague and meandering; words put together to form sentences that really didn’t tell us anything.

So why, at the end of April, is King County (with 5,427 cases and 379 deaths) treated the same as Columbia, Garfield, Ferry, Lincoln, Pacific, Pend Oreille, and Wahkiakum counties (with a combined 13 cases and 0 deaths)? There’s no reasonable and safe plan to let a resident get a haircut in Grays Harbor (12 cases, 0 deaths)?

A clearly defined plan that helps some people get back to work would go a long way.

But I suspect Inslee doesn’t want to be among the first states to open back up. There’s political risk in that decision. It’s also why he wasn’t quick to shutdown, despite being among the first hot spots in the country. He keeps waiting for other states to go first, so he has some political cover, all while buying time with meaningless speeches and tough talk against his critics."

When I first heard about the proposed numerous roundabouts for Columbus, I expressed concern to our city engineer, Kevin Stafford, and my councilman, Charlie Box, that they would present problems for drivers in the Golden Triangle and west Alabama area but I was told that Europeans and some other places love them. Interestingly, a few weeks later an article in the Wall Street Journal with the title ""Roundabout Wrecks Have Engineers Going in Circles"" appeared. While there are generally less fatal accidents at roundabouts there are significantly more crashes. I quote, ""The crash problem has been 'a dirty little secret' in the traffic field, now people are talking about it."" I personally gave councilman Box a copy of this article and brought one by for Mayor Smith's in-box. But apparently roundabouts are coming. I think the only ones to benefit will be the auto body shops.

I think wrecks will have our city engineer ""going in circles"" as have the others where roundabouts are found."

573,573,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/international-business/article-daimlers-earnings-plunge-as-coronavirus-hammers-sales/,Daimler’s earnings plunge as coronavirus hammers sales,Adjusted EBIT for Mercedes-Benz vehicles fell more than 56 per cent to €603 million,www.theglobeandmail.com,"German car and truck maker Daimler reported a plunge of nearly 70 per cent in first-quarter operating profit on Thursday due to the coronavirus pandemic and warned that the cash flow it uses to pay dividends would fall this year.

The maker of Mercedes-Benz vehicles suffered as customers shunned car and truck showrooms during coronavirus lockdowns and analysts said the slide in Daimler’s valuation over the past year put more pressure on it to deepen alliances with rivals.

Daimler said preliminary adjusted first-quarter earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) slumped 68.9 per cent to €719 million ($777 million) while both vehicle sales and revenue would fall this year. Adjusted EBIT for Mercedes-Benz vehicles fell more than 56 per cent to €603 million.

NordLB analyst Frank Schwope said the company’s fourth profit warning since Chief Executive Ola Kaellenius took over in May was no surprise but the pandemic was putting pressure on carmakers to find savings through alliances or mergers.

“Fiat Chrysler and PSA are just the start. Perhaps it is time for Daimler to think about a deal given the low valuation,” he said, referring to the planned merger between the Italian-U.S. car giant and France’s Peugeot.

Daimler’s shares have fallen 52 per cent over the past year to €27.94 per share, leaving its market value at €29.8 billion.

NordLB’s Schwope said three combinations for Daimler were logical: deepening an alliance with BMW or partners Renault and Nissan, or combining with Volvo which shares the same Chinese investor, Geely.

Earlier this month, German luxury car maker BMW reported a 20.6 per cent drop in first-quarter sales and said it was expecting a further decline in demand.

Renault, meanwhile, said on Thursday it was in talks with the French government to secure a state-backed loan worth several billion euros to shore up its liquidity during the pandemic.

Overall, car sales in Europe tumbled by more than 50 per cent last month with Italy - which has been hit particularly hard by the pandemic - reporting the biggest drop of 85.4 per cent, according to data from the European Auto Industry Association.

Germany, Europe’s largest economy, has begun to ease some restrictions imposed because of the coronavirus pandemic, allowing carmakers to restart production.

Mercedes-Benz said on Wednesday it was ramping up engine production at its plant in Bad Cannstatt, Stuttgart, as it gradually reopens factories in Europe using lessons learned from its resumption of production in China.

Across the Atlantic, Ford Motor Co estimated a loss of about $2 billion for the first quarter and had to raise $8 billion from investors to shore up cash reserves.

The number of new unemployment applications last week was less than the 104,217 new claims reported during the previous week.

However, self-employed and gig workers and others not previously able to collect unemployment benefits were only allowed to start filing claims on Monday and are not included in the latest official count. Like other states, Colorado had to come up with a new process for accepting those claims and verifying the amount of money those workers were entitled to. About 51,000 people filed for benefits under that application through Wednesday but just over 10,000 were told to file for regular unemployment and exhaust those benefits first because they had some regular earnings reported on a W-2 form over the last 18 months, labor department spokeswoman Cher Haavind said.

Also this week, the state began paying an extra $600 a week of unemployment benefits from the Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation program to people receiving unemployment payments. People do not have to take any action to receive that extra money."

• Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020 estimated at €4.2 million for the sales
• Cash position of €18.8 million at March 31, 2020 and finalization of €19.5 million in financing line agreements

Amplitude Surgical (ISIN: FR0012789667, Ticker: AMPLI, eligible for PEA-PME plans) (Paris:AMPLI) (""Amplitude"" or the ""Group""), French leader on the global surgical technology market for lower-limb orthopedics, announces its sales for the third quarter of its 2019-20 financial year.

Olivier Jallabert, Chairman and CEO of Amplitude Surgical, states: ""Over the first 9 months of our 2019-20 financial year, Amplitude Surgical continued, until the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, to generate growth driven by the good performance of its international activity and by winning over new clients in France. Despite the estimated €4.2 million impact of COVID-19 in the third quarter, Group sales were stable over the first 9 months. Novastep has continued its ramp-up and now accounts for almost 10% of Group sales, recording growth of more than 89% in the United States. The Group's financial structure is enabling it to cope with the suspension of scheduled surgical procedures in all countries in which the Group operates, with a solid cash position of approximately €18.8 million and additional financing lines currently being finalized. Nevertheless, the current situation and uncertainty regarding its duration and scope lead us to suspend our 2020 targets.

Over the first 9 months of its 2019-20 financial year (to end-March 2020), Amplitude Surgical recorded sales of €76.4 million, down -0.2% at current exchange rates and up +0.2% at constant exchange rates. The COVID-19 pandemic led to all scheduled surgical procedures in France being suspended from March 16, 2020, gradually followed by shutdowns in the other countries in which the Group's international subsidiaries operate. Given the activity observed over the first two weeks of March, the shortfall in terms of sales during the second half of March is estimated at approximately €4.2 million.
• In France, cumulative sales to the end of March totaled €48.1 million, a decrease of -3.5%. 

The impact of the suspension of scheduled surgical procedures is estimated at -€3.5 million. France accounted for 63% of total sales;
• The Group's international activity generated sales of €28.3 million, up 5.9% and 7.2% at constant exchange rates, driven by the performances of the Group's subsidiaries and distributors. The Group's subsidiaries thus recorded sales growth of 5.2% to €20.6 million, notably thanks to the contribution of Brazil, South Africa and the United States for Novastep's activity, while distributors recorded growth of 7.6% to €7.7 million. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Group's international activity in March is estimated at -€0.7 million;
• Novastep, innovative solutions for foot and ankle surgery, recorded very strong growth over the first 9 months with sales totaling 7.4 million (+28.1% at constant exchange rates), driven by the United States (+89.2% at constant exchange rates). The proportion of Novastep sales generated abroad amounts to 60%, and Novastep's activity accounts for 9.6% of total Group sales.

At March 31, 2020, Amplitude Surgical had cash and cash equivalents of almost €18.8 million, which should enable it to cope with the prolonged suspension of scheduled surgical procedures over the coming months. Furthermore, the Group is currently finalizing agreements with its banking partners, as well as with the BPI French investment bank, to secure medium-term financing lines (state-guaranteed bank loan and Atout loan) of approximately €19.5 million.

The Group is expecting the COVID-19 pandemic to have a significant impact on its financial and operational performances for the fourth quarter of its 2019-20 financial year and the year as a whole. Uncertainty regarding the duration and extent of the current situation does not, at this stage, make it possible to accurately estimate its impacts. Because of this, Amplitude Surgical has been forced to suspend the 2020 targets announced in its press release of October 23, 2019. At the same time, the Group is taking all the necessary measures to control its costs, protect its cash position and be ready for a resumption in activity once the sanitary situation allows to have a normal access to the operating rooms.

It is an obvious grey rhino – that is, a high-impact scenario that was always highly likely to occur. The pandemic was sending clear signals that it was getting ready to charge, and too many people with the power to head it off ignored those warnings for too long.

Unlike the black swan that appears only in hindsight, grey rhino theory is forward-looking. It is about actively seeing what’s in front of us and challenging ourselves to act.

The coronavirus crisis is a catalyst for an urgently needed reset of our global mentality, reminding us to hold both governments and ourselves as citizens responsible for stepping up to the clear and present dangers that threaten our survival.

As we move past the initial shock of the pandemic, many of us are thinking about how best to emerge from this global public health, economic and human catastrophe. We don’t want to get “back to normal” because what we accepted as normal is what got us into this mess. Rather, we should want to create a new and better reality.

How could so many leaders across society have turned such a blind eye to giant, red warning flags for so long? Once we understand that, how can we use our knowledge to switch from a passive, fatalistic mode to an active, problem-solving frame?

The alarm bells rung by experts about how poorly prepared the world has been for the pandemics have been well documented. The situation was predicted by the World Health Organisation and even gamed out in a scenario-planning exercise in the US under the Trump administration. In a widely shared TED Talk in 2015, Bill Gates made the point before carefully proceeding to outline what the world needed to do.

Those in policy circles will give you all kinds of knowing reasons why pandemic warnings went ignored: politics, “the problem is too big and expensive and complicated”, entrenched bureaucracies and so on and so forth. They’ll rub their chins to look thoughtful, but have no real answers. They are there to tell you how things are, not how to change them.

Pleading ignorance was particularly fashionable in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, when leaders became too eager to call out, “Black swan! Nobody could have seen it coming!” even though many elements of that crisis were predictable, too.

Together, these attitudes have bred complacency and an accountability vacuum that have made it easy for everyone to dodge responsibility. But that is an explanation, not an excuse.

Instead of focusing mainly on why problems are not readily solvable, our priority needs to be on what it takes, from governments and civil society, to head off grey rhinos.

The solution begins with a reset of expectations. This requires building mutual trust between citizens and governments, beginning with two-way transparency involving governments sharing much more information and citizens consuming and using that information responsibly.

The uncomfortable truth is that governments often fail to make tough choices because citizens don’t want them to. People don’t want short-term pain even if it prevents something much worse down the road. They want to feel secure now. This toxic status quo encourages governments to drag their feet in the face of wicked problems, which in turn leads citizens to lower their expectations of what leaders expect them to do.

The coronavirus pandemic and its domino effect – the most wicked of wicked problems – has upended reality. It has exposed many other thorny and unaddressed challenges. Extreme inequality that puts the greatest burden on those who can least afford it. Deep financial fragilities, including dangerous levels of debt. Inadequate healthcare infrastructure.

When governments try to sweep problems under the rug for too long, they increase the chances of catastrophe when the dam finally breaks. That is why, as painful as it may be, it is better for governments to be open about challenges sooner rather than later.

The coronavirus also illustrates the power of regularly and publicly monitoring progress. Daily releases of epidemiological statistics provide a natural experiment in measuring how governments are doing in the fight to save lives. In every country, these figures are imprecise; because of test shortages, inconsistencies in counting and other technical challenges, they far understate the reality. But they give everyone a way to measure progress.

Contrary to the conclusions of some observers, differences in effectiveness are independent of whether a country’s political system is democratic or not. Rather, they depend upon how transparent and proactive governments are, and how much their populations both trust them to solve the problem and play their own roles in doing so.

Tracking focuses attention on issues while clarifying solutions and reassuring people that progress is possible. If a situation seems hopeless, citizens are less likely to do their part to help fix it or to approve of leaders expending resources to do so.

Hopelessness and a lack of information, moreover, leave the door open for citizens to make up their own, alternate realities. Social media has allowed everyone to become instant epidemiologists, market sages, economists and one-size-fits-all critics. Tribes assemble, picking and choosing the information that suits them.

Protesters in the US, for instance, have been endangering themselves and others by demanding that the government loosen stay-at-home orders. They see themselves as preserving their “liberty” to work and to be entertained.

Choosing one’s own reality is a way of asserting control over a situation when people feel they have none, and little in recent memory has made so many people feel so powerless as the coronavirus and the economic destruction it has wrought.

Governments ought to recognise the benefits of being upfront about the nature of the problems they face, involving citizens in building solutions and then tracking their progress. Citizens, of course, must do their part, too. They ought to heed information and consume it responsibly, differentiating between what they need to hear and what they simply want to.

The rise of open-data projects and participatory budgeting have allowed governments to invite input from citizens more directly than ever before. Through these platforms, policymakers communicate the problem and the steps they are taking to fix it, then solicit feedback from citizen stakeholders. This can change citizens’ expectations of what can and should be done, making tough decisions easier.

Governments also are benefiting from comparing their own progress to that of their peers. Performance-tracking tools like Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index, the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Index and the Programme for International Student Assessment (better known as PISA) all have helped to shape government policies for the better.

Similarly, the Sustainable Development Goals provide a powerful road map for tracking initiatives to address many of the grey rhino risks the world still faces: inequality, hunger, climate and 14 other worthy efforts.

There is one final benefit to these tools that ought to appeal to anyone in a position of power: they make it easier to give credit to leaders who work toward solutions to pressing policy problems, and hold accountable those who kick the crisis down the road.

The death brought to at least three, the number of persons to have died this year from injuries sustained in incidents involving JUTC buses.

The latest incident involved 44-year-old Eletia Brown, who was fatally struck by the vehicle along Port Royal Street in downtown Kingston.

According to the state-owned bus company, Brown was struck by the vehicle shortly before 5pm.

“The matter is being investigated by the police and our internal accident investigation department,” the JUTC said in a statement.

The company also said the driver has been pulled from active duty, pending further investigations.

It also expressed “sincere condolences” to the family and friends of the deceased on their loss.

Meanwhile, JUTC buses were involved in two fatal accidents in January.

The first incident took place on January 19 along a section of the Green Acres main road in St Catherine.

According to the company, around 4.30 pm, one of its chartered buses was travelling along the Green Acres main road heading in the direction of Spanish Town. On reaching a section of the roadway, the bus driver noticed an International tractor trailer head travelling in the opposite direction.

“The JUTC driver reported that when he observed the International tractor trailer head approaching the bus, he veered further left, mounted the embankment and stopped. He said the tractor trailer made contact with the bus while passing, and upon examination of the damage to the bus, he saw a man lying on the roadway suffering from injuries,” the JUTC said in a statement.

The driver reported that he called the police for assistance and the injured man was taken to the Spanish Town Hospital, where he later died.

In the second incident on January 25, an elderly pedestrian died after he was struck by a JUTC bus in downtown Kingston.

The deceased was identified as 73-year-old Daryl Wright of 11 Miles in Bull Bay, St Thomas.

The JUTC said the accident occurred along East Parade in the vicinity of Coke Methodist Church.

It was reported that around 3.25 pm, the bus was heading south along East Parade in the right lane, when on reaching Coke Methodist Church, the driver suddenly heard an impact to the right side of the unit.

The driver said upon hearing the sound, he quickly stopped the bus and found out that an elderly male pedestrian had been hit, and that he had fallen to the roadway.

Police personnel who were quick on the scene, took the injured pedestrian to hospital for treatment. However, Wright later succumbed to his injuries."

Social distancing has silenced music clubs in the District amid the coronavirus pandemic and now struggling venues and artists have turned live streaming to connect with their audience and generate some income.

CORONAVIRUS RESOURCES: Everything You Need to Know

The Pearl Street Warehouse at The Wharf in Southwest D.C. is usually packed for shows, but it’s been empty for six weeks now.

What was supposed to be a breakout in the venue’s third year in operation has become an increasingly uncertain future.

No concerts mean no revenue for the Pearl Street Warehouse, the musical artists who perform there, or the staff that works there.

The owners of the Pearl Street Warehouse say they’ve been forced to lay off about 30 employees. The three staffers that are still employed spend the day, not getting ready for music shows, but preparing family-style meals from their kitchen, selling liquor bottles from their bar.

But live music? A crowd? That’s the beating heart of a music club, and that’s stopped. The hope is that heartbeat will restart soon, but that is far from a certainty for worried owners.

“We don’t know when we come back if we can have 50 people in a 300 person room, or if we have 25, or if people are going to have to sit at tables” he adds “That’s not what a rock and roll show is or a music venue is,"" said co-owner Nick Fontana.

Singer-songwriter Maggie Miles, from Purcellville, Virginia, is now living in Nashville.

Maggie has been performing online as part of Pearl Street Warehouse’s “Quarantine Concerts Series”.

The concerts are shown on Facebook Live and on the club’s YouTube page.

Maggie’s not making any money from this now but says it’s at least letting her connect with new fans in a new way.

“Pearl Street’s honestly been the coolest connection to have because I was supposed to release a record last month and I was going to be coming back to dc to a record release show,"" said Maggie.

Her concert scheduled for May 30 at the Pearl Street Warehouse had to be postponed. She says the club’s online series has been helpful in maintaining a bond with her audience

“And luckily they’re such a great venue they’ve been able to be flexible with this situation through this process,"" said Maggie.

Her new album “Am I Drowning, Or Learning How To Swim” has been pushed back to an August release.

Pearl Street Warehouse was turned down for its initial attempt to apply for a Payroll Protection Program but is hopeful they’ll be successful in the next round.

In the meantime, the venue is now one of 450 music clubs across the country that have banded together for The National Independent Venue Association. The goal is to get Congress’s attention to help with financial aid so small live music venues don’t disappear."

Investors tilted toward emerging markets from safe-haven assets like the dollar and government bonds. Gold prices jumped as much as 1.5% to top a one-week high on hopes for the impact of stimulus spending.

Major U.S. indexes initially rose after news that U.S. jobless claims fell to 4.4 million, a decline from 5.2 million the week before, but still about 200,000 more than expected. A record 26 million Americans, representing 16% of the labor force, have sought unemployment benefits since March 21.

“The market is ignoring all the weak data so far, it’s priced in,” said Priya Misra, head of global rates strategy for TD Securities.

“We have moved ahead from the second quarter being awful,” Misra said, adding that market participants were turning toward the outlook for the third and fourth quarters.

A discouraging report at midday that Gilead Sciences experimental coronavirus drug flopped in its first randomized clinical trial cooled initial optimism that had major U.S. indexes up more than 1%.

Oil soared after oil-producing nations said they would accelerate production to counter the oversupply that caused record plunges early this week.

U.S. crude CLc1 rose 23.66% to $17.04 per barrel and Brent LCOc1 was at $21.73, up 6.68% on the day.

Investors expected the U.S. House of Representatives to pass legislation on Thursday to authorize another $484 billion for coronavirus relief, pushing the total crisis spending near an unprecedented $3 trillion.

European Union leaders similarly added hope for the future. Some 27 leaders convened by video conference to consider adopting a bigger common budget, grants to stricken economies and joint bond sales to finance recovery from the pandemic.

Investors are anxious to see “how quickly EU policy-makers will move towards area-wide fiscal risk-sharing,” said George Cole, an economist at Goldman Sachs."

In a Facebook post on Thursday, Lee said he had a telephone discussion with Modi about the ongoing COVID-19 situation in Singapore and India.

During the call, Lee said he acknowledged the sacrifices migrant workers have made to work in Singapore.

""I assured him (Modi) that we will care for Indian migrant workers here, just as we care for Singaporeans. The migrant workers made personal sacrifices to come to work here. They have made many contributions to Singapore, so we have a responsibility for them,"" said Lee.

""Appreciate PM Modi's affirmation of our efforts in looking after the migrant workers, and his assurance that they will not forget this,"" Lee added.

He thanked Modi for India's help in bringing back stranded Singaporeans from India. Singapore flew out 699 of its citizens in early April after they were stranded due to the coronavirus lockdown in India.

After speaking with Lee, Modi said the strategic partnership between India and Singapore can contribute to stability and prosperity in the post-COVID world.

""Exchanged views on the COVID-19 pandemic with PM @leehsienloong, and thanked him for the support and care being extended to Indian citizens in Singapore,"" Modi tweeted.

The Singapore PM has called India's nationwide lockdown since late March ""not a simple decision"" in a huge country of 1.3 billion people.

India and Singapore are strategic partners with extensive economic ties, he said.

""We agreed to work together on the challenges posed by the pandemic, keep supply chains intact, and keep essential supplies flowing,"" said Lee in the post.

The two leaders also discussed the ""extensive economic ties"" Singapore and India share.

The High Commission of India in Singapore told The Straits Times that Prime Minister Modi called his Singapore counterpart as part of his ongoing engagement with various world leaders on coronavirus.

As of April 19, over 1,600 Indian nationals have been diagnosed with COVID-19 in Singapore, according to The Straits Times report.

The Singapore Health Ministry has stopped releasing individual case details, including nationality, after Sunday last, reported the Singapore Daily.

Indians make up the second-largest group -- in terms of nationality -- of coronavirus patients in Singapore.

Bangladeshis are the largest national group with more than 2,900 patients. Singaporeans are third on the list with over 1,100 patients.

Singapore currently is in the middle of its circuit breaker exercise, which is a series of restriction to control the spread of coronavirus.

The University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation Trust (UHMBT) has already recruited many of the 47 people who have so far volunteered but are on the hunt for more.

Barry Rigg, Head of Patient Experience at UHMBT, said: “The public is right to be proud of you all – and we echo that sentiment.”

Members of the public are welcome to apply to volunteer at UHMBT through the trust’s ‘Helping Hands’ scheme.

Volunteer support is welcomed on hospital wards and at the trust’s Community Recovery Centres in Kendal and Barrow.

To apply to UHMBT’s Helping Hands scheme visit www.just-r.com/enquire/volunteer/ to sign up.

A total of 665 COVID-19 deaths were recorded in England yesterday with 90 in the north west and two further fatalities at hospitals run by UHMBT.

Meanwhile, work is continuing on a recovery bed site at Kendal Leisure Centre.

At the beginning of the month, the British army was deployed to deliver beds and other equipment to the Kendal site.

The Kendal site is intended to house patients that are in the process of recovering from COVID-19 - as opposed to patients exhibiting acute symptoms - but are not yet ready to be discharged, should hospitals in the area reach full capacity.

Hospitals chiefs stress it is an emergency resource they hope to never be required to use.

UHMBT said yesterday that it had discharged a total of 192 patients who had recovered from coronavirus.

UHMBT is also urging non-COVID patients to use hospitals without fear, amid concerns some are going without treatment out of a wish not to add pressure or risk infection.

Medical director Dr Shahedal Bari said: “If you are suffering with a health issue and have doubts, please do not hesitate to seek help.

""We would rather you called 999 or attended the A&E to find an honest mistake has been made than be too late to save a person’s life.

“The doctors and nurses may look a little different at the moment, but it’s for everyone’s safety."""

Researchers analysed Veterans Health Administration medical centre records of those confirmed to have COVID-19, and died or were discharged by April 11.



The medicine, which was originally developed to treat malaria, was hailed by Mr Trump as a “miracle drug” after one French study claimed it was a potential coronavirus cure.

“What do you have to lose?” he said during one of his daily coronavirus briefings earlier this month. “I’m not looking at it one way or another. If it does work, it would be a shame if we didn’t do it early. But what do I know, I’m not a doctor. But I have common sense.”



But according to the study, 28 per cent of the veterans who were given hydroxychloroquine plus routine care died, compared to 11 per cent of those getting routine care alone.

And 22 per cent who received both hydroxychloroquine plus the antibiotic azithromycin died, though researchers said the difference between the group and usual care was significant.

Hydroxychloroquine made no difference in preventing needs for a ventilator.

One rare potential side effect of the drug, particularly when taken in conjunction with azithromycin, can be ventricular arrhythmia, which in some patients can prove fatal. A rare side effect means it occurs between one in 1000 and one in 10,000 cases.

However researchers did not track side effects.



Studies in other countries have yielded similar results, diminishing hope for hydroxychloroquine and its close relative chloroquine.

According to the LA Times, a French study found hydroxychloroquine reduced neither deaths nor ICU admissions among patients who received it.

A Brazilian study was shut down after two deaths and heart problems among patients who were given a high dose of chloroquine.

A Chinese study showed patients who received the drug didn’t recover any faster or better than patients who didn’t get the drug.

Another hydroxychloroquine study is currently taking place on 20 patients at Upstate University Hospital in Syracuse. Chief of infectious diseases Dr Stephen Thomas said researchers hope to know within a few weeks “if it’s safe and has a clinical benefit”.

Dr Anthony Fauci, a top infectious disease expert and a member of the White House coronavirus task force, has previously warned against unproven “anecdotal” stories of individuals who have reported success with hydroxychloroquine.

He said there are concerns about side effects and toxicities, and that it also made it more difficult for those who do need the drug to access it.

The case has stirred public opinion since the discovery on Tuesday of the first nine bodies near the village of Baakline in the Chouf area southeast of Beirut, in what Prime Minister Hassan Diab described as an “appalling crime.”

“Police found the perpetrator at 2 am hiding in the garden of a home in the area of Ainbal near Baakline and detained him,” the judicial source said.

“He admitted that he suspected his wife was cheating on him with his brother, so he decided to stab her to death in the marital home,” the source added.

The wife’s family has denied accusations against her, in a statement published by local media.

The man then invited his brother to join him on a hunting trip to the Baakline river, the judicial source said, where he killed him with a hunting rifle.

His body was the 10th to be discovered.

In a subsequent rampage, the man killed anyone in his path, including six Syrians -- including a man and his two boys -- and another brother, the source said.

Local media said another Lebanese man was also killed.

On social media Thursday, the hashtag #Baakline was trending, with users condemning the mass killings.

“Down with disgusting male excuses. He is a criminal and a killer,” women’s rights activist Hayat Mirshad wrote on Twitter.

The grisly events come as Lebanon is under lockdown to stem the spread of the novel coronavirus, and grappling with its worst economic crisis since the 1975-1990 war.

April 22 (Reuters) - Wall Street’s main indexes surged on Wednesday as oil prices recovered some ground and Congress looked on course to seal nearly $500 billion more in aid to help small businesses ride out the coronavirus crisis.

U.S. crude and benchmark Brent prices edged higher after a collapse in the past two days, sending the S&P 500 energy index up 3.1%.

All the 11 major S&P 500 sub-indexes were trading higher, as the U.S. Senate unanimously approved the new relief package, adding to trillions of dollars in stimulus that have helped Wall Street rebound from its March lows.

The House of Representatives is expected to clear the bill on Thursday.

“The (stimulus) response times have been way faster than what you saw in 2008. What you’re seeing is the tail risk removal that stops the equity downturn and allows the market to actually look forward,” said Anik Sen, global head of equities at PineBridge Investments in New York.

The benchmark S&P 500 is still 17% below its record high as state-wide shutdowns spark layoffs and crush consumer spending, putting several sectors at the risk of collapse.

Estimates for U.S. jobless claims for the latest week range as high as 5.5 million, while a reading on April U.S. factory activity is likely to fall to levels last seen during the 2008 financial crisis. Both reports are due Thursday.

Analysts have drastically cut their S&P 500 earnings expectations for the first and second quarters and are now projecting a corporate recession for 2020, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

A week after the big U.S. banks issued dismal 2020 forecasts, consumer discretionary and technology firms fared slightly better as the lockdown measures boosted demand for online streaming and home delivery of meals.

“I think this earnings season is really going to be a function of which companies and which industries are holding up... and are able to withstand the decline in this market and to ride it out,” said Nancy Perez, senior portfolio manager at Boston Private Wealth in Miami.

Investors will also be paying close attention to capital allocation from companies going forward, Perez further added, “you have to have the cash to sustain and ride out to the other side.”

Fast-casual chain Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc jumped 13% after it reported soaring digital and home delivery sales and said it had enough cash and liquidity to get through the next year.

Netflix Inc more than doubled its own projections for new customers in the first quarter. However, its shares fell 2.8% as it forecast a weaker second half if the lockdown measures were to be lifted.

In another sharp swing that has now become a common occurrence on Wall Street, at 12:32 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 447.03 points, or 1.94%, at 23,465.91 and the S&P 500 was up 58.30 points, or 2.13%, at 2,794.86.

The Nasdaq Composite was up 195.06 points, or 2.36%, at 8,458.29.

Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 3.38-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 2.38-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.

The S&P index recorded two new 52-week highs and one new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 20 new highs and 12 new lows. (Reporting by C Nivedita and Shreyashi Sanyal in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D’Silva, Sagarika Jaisinghani and Arun Koyyur)"

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.

Popular fast casual restaurant Chipotle Mexican Grill agreed to pay a $25 million criminal fine stemming from norovirus outbreaks that sickened customers from 2015 to 2018, prosecutors said Tuesday.

More than 1,100 patrons fell ill from the outbreaks that led to California -based Chipotle to be charged with two counts of violating federal food guidelines ""by adulterating food while held for sale after shipment in interstate commerce,"" the U.S. Attorney said in statement.

The $25 million penalty is ""the largest fine ever imposed in a food-safety case,"" prosecutors said.

“Chipotle failed to ensure that its employees both understood and complied with its food safety protocols, resulting in hundreds of customers across the country getting sick,” Los Angeles-based U.S. Attorney Nick Hanna said.

Chipotle confirmed the deal with prosecutors and said the company is ""committed to continue enhancing its already robust food safety policies, practices, and procedures.""

“This settlement represents an acknowledgment of how seriously Chipotle takes food safety every day and is an opportunity to definitively turn the page on past events,” company chairman and CEO Brian Niccol said in a statement.

In the settlement, Chipotle admitted to a pattern of ""store-level"" missteps that included failed ""exclusion of restaurant employees who were sick or recently had been sick, as well as a failure by restaurant employees to hold food at appropriate temperatures to prevent and control for the growth of foodborne pathogens,"" according to a statement by prosecutors.

The settlement singled out Chipotle restaurants in Los Angeles and Boston, as well as other locations in California, Ohio and Virginia.

The Boston incident in December 2015 sickened several members of the Boston College Eagles basketball team.

And over the course of eight days in July 2018, about 647 people got sick after dining in Powell, Ohio, due to ""critical violations of the local food regulations, including those specific to time and temperature controls for lettuce and beans,"" prosecutor said.

The chain on Tuesday insisted it's been improving safety standards since these outbreaks occurred.

“Over the last four years, we instituted several enhancements to our food preparation and food handling practices to lower the risk of foodborne illnesses,"" company VP for food safety Kerry Bridges said in a statement.

""These measures include reducing the number of employees who come into contact with ingredients, safeguards to minimize the risk that an ingredient is undercooked, and sophisticated microbiological testing of raw ingredients to help ensure quality and safety before they are shipped to restaurants."""

I started my Penn State career in Hazleton. There were hardly any extracurriculars or clubs to join. When I came to University Park as a junior, I knew I needed to make the most of my last two years.

After a semester of taking overwhelmingly challenging courses, I decided to change my major from education to photojournalism in the fall of my junior year — even though I had only considered photography as a hobby.

One of my friends suggested I joined the Collegian, and that has made all the difference.

In a matter of 18 months, I went from having little-to-no experience in photography to taking pictures at the Little League World Series. I traveled to Texas for a college football bowl game, covered a national college wrestling championship tournament and took photos at a multitude of other events.

I owe it all to the Collegian.

Without the opportunities that the Collegian has offered me, I don’t think I would have a resume or portfolio even close to what I have today. Aside from this, one of the greatest blessings the Collegian has given me is the memories I now have captured through my camera.

I know I’ll look back on these photos for years to come, and for that, I not only thank the Collegian, but also Penn State."
596,596,https://www.680news.com/2020/04/23/airline-customers-legally-entitled-to-refund-says-passenger-rights-advocate/,Airline customers legally entitled to refund says passenger rights advocate,,www.680news.com,"After weeks of pressure, the Canadian agency responsible for air travellers’ rights is clarifying a statement that passengers say is being used by airlines to deny them refunds for canceled flights. But one advocate says it’s not enough.

Since mid March, airlines and travellers have both been left scrambling as COVID-19 has all but shut down international travel.

Flight cancellations have left thousands of Canadian passengers, some whom are out of work, in search of refunds. Instead of getting their money back, multiple airlines are insisting they take vouchers instead.

On their website in late March, the Canadian Transportation Agency stated it was important to “strike a fair and sensible balance between passenger protection and airlines’ operational realities.” It went on to say that “generally speaking, an appropriate approach in the current context could be for airlines to provide affected passengers with vouchers or credits for future travel.”

Multiple passengers who’ve reached out to CityNews say airline and travel companies are now portraying the statement posted on the CTA’s website as a legally binding document, even though it isn’t.

Conceding that they’ve been asked “a number of questions” about their stance, the CTA has now posted an update on its website writing that their “statement on vouchers, although not a binding decision, offers suggestions to airlines and passengers in the context of a once-in-a-century pandemic, global collapse of air travel, and mass cancellation of flights for reasons outside the control of airlines.”

Passenger rights advocate Gabor Lukacs believes the CTA is “clearly acting outside its mandate” going on to say, “commenting on disputes that would likely come before the CTA is explicitly prohibited by the CTA’s own Code of Conduct.”

As an administrative tribunal, the CTA is responsible for making impartial decisions about disputes between passengers and airlines. Lukacs notes that “in a democratic society” it’s unacceptable for the CTA to give “advance opinion or suggestions,” as the agency’s original statement appears to do.

In their updated statement, the CTA writes that airlines are not obligated in Canada to “include refunds in their tariffs” for flights cancelled beyond their control. Lukacs again takes issue with this, saying the CTA is misleading the public and ignoring their own legal rulings.

“The law has been and remains that passengers are entitled to a refund,” he says, adding “Canadian passengers deserve an impartial regulator that enforces the law.”

His advocacy group, Air Passenger Rights, is currently asking the Federal Court of Appeal for an injunction that would see the CTA’s initial online statement on vouchers removed and replaced with a notice for the public that the “legality of the statement is being challenged in court.” Until the court delivers its ruling, the passenger advocate also wants the federal agency to be prohibited from dealing with COVID-19 related complaints.

The CTA has declined to comment on the case as it’s before the Court of Appeal."

If you’d like to learn more or contact the project leads, please contact MetroLab at info@metrolabnetwork.org for more information.

In this month’s installment of the Innovation of the Month series, we explore the work of the University of Missouri-Kansas City (UMKC) and the cities of Kansas City, Mo. (KCMO), and the Unified Government of Wyandotte County and Kansas City, Kan. (Unified Government), on a Draft Model Data Handling Policy, with several collaborators.

MetroLab’s Ben Levine gathered information about the development of the project from Tony Luppino, a UMKC Professor involved in multi-disciplinary and multi-institution civic entrepreneurship initiatives and a leader of the project; Kate Garman, senior associate at Cityfi (and formerly an innovation analyst with KCMO, and smart city coordinator and technology policy adviser with the city of Seattle); Alan Howze, chief knowledge officer of the United Government; Abigail Eccher, Performance and Innovation Project Manager at the Unified Government; and Aaron Deacon, Managing Director of KC Digital Drive. Levine also obtained perspectives on the project from several participants in a session Luppino and Deacon organized to gather feedback on an annotated draft of the Model Data Handling Policy at the MetroLab Network annual Summit in late 2019.

Ben Levine: Can you describe the origin and objective of the Model Data Handling Policy project and who has been involved in it?

Tony Luppino: Teams of students and faculty primarily from the School of Law and the School of Computing and Engineering at UMKC developed the Model Data Handling Policy (MDHP) project in an interdisciplinary graduate-level course administered by the law school, with input from several collaborators with the course, including interested community members, government and educational institutions. The draft MDHP contains a set of principles, policies, procedures and checklists addressing a city’s responsibilities and opportunities with data handling. It covers the collection, creation, storage, use, transfer and dissemination of data, as well as the use of data platforms and related security, risk mitigation and breach damage containment measures. The current objective is to refine the draft with collaborators across the MetroLab Network and create a next iteration that we hope will be useful to cities throughout the U.S. that might embrace some of its principles or implementation suggestions, tailored to their specific circumstances.

The project began when Kate Garman, then working in KCMO’s Innovation Office on Smart City initiatives, sought research input from UMKC’s Law, Technology and Public Policy course to help inform the city’s consideration of both privacy laws and sunshine laws from the citizen perspective, and best practices in associated policies and in communications with the public.

Kate Garman: As the city was considering new technology in the right of way, it was paramount to understand privacy implications and how to balance that with transparency. Working with the UMKC School of Law was a natural fit, and they were an excellent partner to take on such a project.

Alan Howze: Programs like the Law, Technology and Public Policy course at UMKC, and the student interest they inspire, are a tremendous catalyst to civic innovation programs and initiatives in the region. Student and university interest in these public projects continues to increase, providing opportunities for collaboration and growth, and delivering real value to local governments and the communities they serve.

Abigail Eccher: Having worked on the project as a law student before graduating and entering a position in the Unified Government, I believe students who engage with “real world” municipal problems succeed by commingling a traditional legal education with interdisciplinary concepts such as change management and ecosystemic thinking to overcome chronic obstacles. In a world that is often defined by case law, statutes and treatises, students in the Law, Technology and Public Policy program are turning to use cases, case studies and stakeholder input to solve problems most cities have experienced for decades. Applying these fresh, collaborative insights and strategies to “legacy predicaments” often results in a much-needed shakeup of legacy processes.

Luppino: Across several semesters and teams, the project evolved into development of the multi-faceted draft MDHP. The draft was based on research on various legal and policy issues, study of relevant initiatives in several other cities, exploration of data handling in KCMO, and review of data sharing agreements from some other cities as well. It sets out core principles, operating procedures, policies on uses of data for public benefit, risk mitigation and audit measures, and a recommended governance/oversight structure that includes mechanisms for informed and timely community input. In appendices, the draft provides checklists for negotiating and evaluating data-sharing agreements with different types of collaborators and vendors.

Levine: Who has participated in the advancement and vetting of the project?

Luppino: In between phases within the UMKC course, the project was advanced by the Legal Technology Laboratory, a UMKC-led initiative supported by the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation. After incorporating feedback from local government and community representatives in the Kansas City region, a revised and annotated draft was vetted at a roundtable session at the MetroLab Summit in 2019. The featured speakers in that roundtable, each of whom commented on the Draft, included Denise Linn Riedl, chief innovation officer of South Bend, Ind., Eric Jackson, data and analytics program manager in Asheville, N.C., Almis Uldrys, deputy chief of staff for innovation and policy for the city of San Diego, and Amie Stepanovich, executive director of the Silicon Flatirons Center for Law, Technology and Entrepreneurship at the University of Colorado-Boulder. The session elicited input from those featured speakers, as well as representatives of several other cities and universities in the MetroLab Network in attendance.

Denise Linn Riedl: Cities are experiencing so many common challenges when it comes to data, it only makes sense that we would collaborate together to workshop shared solutions. As chief innovation officer, I often tap into the expertise and best practices seen in other cities. The more city teams and privacy experts shape and vet this model policy, the stronger it becomes.

Levine: Tell us about the need for this project. What risks are presented when cities lack a data-handling model?

Luppino: When we asked participants at the MetroLab Summit about their concerns around data handling and privacy, their responses validated several of our own concerns. There was discussion around citizen perceptions of lack of transparency on data collection, usage and sharing, and insufficient attention to community input; the need for enhanced data and network security design and audit protocols; desirability of cross-department coordination on data-handling standards and practices, and on sharing of data to improve effectiveness and equity in delivering public services; and risks of inadequate checks and balances on data sharing decisions. Moreover, several participants confirmed our observation that while many cities have adopted policies for “open data portals,” it does not seem many have adopted a comprehensive policy addressing, with a duty-of-care mindset, the many types of data a city collects, stores and transmits on a daily basis — but are now seeing the need for such a comprehensive policy.

Levine: What are some examples of data you considered in your project? Are certain types of data more important to consider for privacy and security than others?

Aaron Deacon: The starting point for this project was an increasing array of sensors and communications technology either owned by the city or deployed on city infrastructure. Photos of license plates or video of faces, MAC addresses of devices accessing public Wi-Fi points, tracked interactions with public kiosks — in the private sector, we have grown accustomed to ubiquitous data collection, but there is still a lot of work to do to translate that to the public sphere. Beyond personally identifiable information, the document loosely defines a category of “sensitive data.” This classification is a good example of where we are seeking additional feedback on how different cities are classifying and treating different types of data.

Almis Udrys: In San Diego, we categorized data into public and non-public classifications to ensure consideration of privacy and security, and then sorted it further as high-value public and non-high-value public based on our understanding of data the public and/or our own workforce would be interested in accessing in a machine-readable way.

Amie Stepanovich: Collection, retention and use of data about people’s daily lives can have broad negative impacts, from risks of manipulation to outright discrimination, particularly for traditionally marginalized or vulnerable communities. Because of these impacts, any move to integrate technology should be postponed until robust legal protections and safeguards are in place, including transparency and accountability mechanisms. Given the advances in machine learning tools that can be used to reveal personal information from data points that may appear not sensitive, these protections should apply to any data linked or reasonably linkable to a specific person or household.

Levine: How do you make this a usable tool for leaders in cities of varying sizes and resources?

Luppino: While the draft policy was designed to be of potential value to any city in the U.S., feedback at the vetting sessions to date have raised questions about whether cities with less staffing and resources than others might have difficulty in implementing all components of it. For example, the oversight system it lays out requires a combination of staffing with varying levels of training in data handling. As we approach the next iteration with collaborators, we are looking to make it more distinctly modular, so that a given city seeing particular value in certain parts can adopt those parts. We also plan to explore using technology to make the policy more accessible and implementable, which has been an aspirational part of the project (see the project’s description here).

Riedl: The model policy is ambitious, but I believe many of its recommendations can be right-sized to accommodate the context of smaller cities. We're talking about this now in South Bend. While smaller cities have smaller staffs and smaller budgets to operationalize this work, it can also be easier for smaller cities to institute cross-departmental change. That's what this model policy is truly about: an institution-wide commitment to better data management and sharing practices.

Levine: If data is managed well and security is robust, what does a data- and technology-enabled city look like? What are the most important problems that will be solved?

Eric Jackson: There is a significant danger of seeing smart city technology and data-driven decision-making as essentially technical tools. Obviously they have technical aspects, but those are comparatively straightforward. What is really critical is to ensure that data governance explicitly ties the use and handling of data and analytics to the core values of the community. In Asheville, that means that we must lead with equity, that we scrutinize whether data adequately represents everyone impacted by its use, and that we always prioritize concerns about potential harm. When anchored this way, data governance becomes a powerful tool for rebuilding trust with the community and tackling our toughest challenges, from economic mobility to environmental sustainability.

Levine: What are the next steps? What are your goals for this project?

Luppino: From early on, we felt MetroLab Network would be an exceptionally valuable community of practice for civic leaders interested in using technology in people-first, creative, and responsible ways. As discussed at the Roundtable Session at the 2019 MetroLab Summit, the next step is to create an expanded working group to crowdsource a revised iteration of the draft MDHP, including representatives of cities and educational institutions in the network who have already expressed interest in participating, and others who would like to join the group and produce a helpful tool for municipalities across the country. So we are inviting all MetroLab members and other parties potentially interested in becoming part of this collaboration to contact me, Tony Luppino, at luppinoa@umkc.edu, to request a review copy of the draft policy."

Out of 157 units owned by pureplay listed fast moving consumer goods ( FMCG ) firms, 68 facilities, or 43%, are in Covid-19 red zone districts, mainly in Himachal Pradesh, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Uttarakhand and West Bengal, industry insiders said.Sourcing of raw material and movement of products within the affected region are other big issues faced by FMCG companies, they said. “We have requested companies without any instances of Covid-19 cases be permitted to operate even if they fall within a hotspot, provided they adopt and implement all safety protocols and screening measures, and follow social distancing norms,” said Shahrukh Khan, executive director, operations, Dabur. Forced closure of some factories of suppliers and micro, small and medium enterprises that Dabur depends on is affecting its supply chain, Khan said.About 76% of micro and small businesses are completely shut down in top 12 Indian cities and 60% of them are uncertain about their financial health for the next two weeks, according to a new report by Kantar, a global research firm owned by communications and advertising giant WPP. Makers of essentials and packaged food have seen large production cuts and supply disruptions after factories were closed in several places by law enforcement authorities. While many have opened now, police have restricted movement of employees, while many have refused to come to work for fear of catching the disease or have gone back to their villages and towns.“Restarting manufacturing units will be a key challenge for FMCG companies and will depend on the impact of Covid-19 in their respective locations,” said Abhijeet Kundu, an analyst at Antique Stock Broking. “This will have a bearing on the overall capacity utilisation, sales and supply chain across companies.” An Antique analysis says 46% factories of the country’s largest FMCG player, Hindustan Unilever , are in hotspot regions while the number is as high as 61% for its rival ITC.Varun Berry, managing director, Britannia Industries , said it is now utilising 75% of its production capacity, but the lockdown has impacted its distribution. “Things are getting better, but the biggest issue is labour in factories and drivers for trucks,” he said. “Scaling up or down, or suspension of operations is dependent on directions of the authorities.” Nestle has 50% units in red zone districts."

That’s an omen for the global recovery, says Principal Global Investors chief strategist Seema Shah, who believes that investors aren’t pricing in a slower than expected return to “business as usual”.

“This should provide some insights for the rest of the world: reopening will be hard,” said Ms Shah. “Any return of daily routine and economic activity will take time, a prospect reinforced by secondary waves of infection now cropping up in parts of Asia.”

“Investors should, therefore, brace themselves for prolonged economic weakness. Although governments are looking to lift lockdowns, the reopening of economies will be only gradual, compounding financial strains for businesses and households.”

While monetary authorities have signalled that they will continue to stabilise markets – most notably the Federal Reserve, which has essentially pledged unlimited quantitative easing – that will do little for the sections of the real economy most impacted by the coronavirus or prevent cautious consumer behaviour.

And although Ms Shah believes that markets might have seen the bottom after a trough in March, they’re still extremely positive – with little reason.

“With financial markets signalling a narrative that appears to be very detached from the likely jilted and slow economic recovery, equities are likely to retrace some of their recent gains,” Ms Shah said. “At least investors can take comfort from the fact that the worst of the pandemic is likely behind us, the market bottoming process is underway, and with markets typically leading the economy, we are – plausibly – clear of the market lows.”

deVere CEO Nigel Green has voiced similar concerns, saying that investors weren’t pricing in a potential second wave of coronavirus infections while ignoring headwinds like the upcoming US presidential election and the possibility of a “no-deal” Brexit.

“It would appear that the financial markets are oblivious to the obvious and serious financial threat of a potential second wave of the coronavirus,” Mr Green said. “Alarmingly, this does not seem to have been priced in.”

“The markets’ bullish sentiment during this mass disruption and dislocation would be baffling enough, but there are also other headwinds on the horizon."

“We endorsed the agreements on three important safety nets for workers, businesses and sovereigns, amounting to 540 billion euros,” said President of the European Council Charles Michel.

“We call for the package to be operational by 1 June 2020. We also agreed to work toward a recovery fund which is needed and urgent.”

A longer term recovery plan has also been discussed, but the EU is struggling to come to an agreement over debt distribution, with northern European countries, like the Netherlands and Germany, reluctant to share too much debt out of fear of having to foot the bill for others.

More than 100,000 Europeans have died so far from COVID-19, and country-wide lockdowns have hit economies hard.

With business only slowly starting to open in some countries, the urgent need for funds in hard-hit countries like Italy and Spain has never been starker.

“This whole endeavour is about protecting the integrity of our single market and our union, and if we do it well, and succeed, then the investments will have been worth every single cent we spend on them now,” said Ursula von der Leyen, the Commission President.

She said the only “instrument that can deliver this magnitude of task behind the recovery” is the European budget, which she said is trusted and designed for investments for cohesion.

Even before these new funds are agreed, the EU's institutions and member countries combined have mobilised around 3.3 trillion euros for health services, small businesses, embattled airlines or wage support for people unable to work.

Before the rescue package was announced, European Parliament President David Sassoli said Europe faced what could be its worst recession in a century.

He referred to it as “this new Marshall Plan for Europe”, but with funds coming from European countries and economies.

There’s still lots of work to do for the EU to come to agreement on further measures.

The EU has been split over the budget for more than a year, with major contributors like Germany and the Netherlands reluctant to fill the estimated 75-billion-euro spending gap left by Britain's departure from the EU."

From Garbhasana to others, they perform every move in a flow and that leaves one awestruck. However, the cutest thing came towards the end of the video where Rohman planted a sweet kiss on Sushmita’s forehead, and the couple sat together post workout. They make us love them even more with each post. What do you think?"
603,603,https://safehaven.com/commodities/energy/Could-Working-From-Home-Become-The-New-Normal.html,Could Working From Home Become The New Normal?,"Millions of Americans are now working from home and it is weighing on oil demand, but what if this way of life becomes the new normal?",safehaven.com,"It's day 33 for me. I leave the house to walk the dog and occasionally swing by the corner store. But that's about it. I haven't ridden in a car since March 20th, nor a bus or any form of transportation other than my bicycle. I'm sure I'm not alone, and it's got me thinking. How exactly has this lockdown impacted oil demand? And perhaps more importantly, will this way of life become somewhat of a new normal? Most articles mention that COVID-19 has had a devastating impact on the demand for crude oil. That much is obvious. Storage facilities across the globe are filled to the brim. The situation is so dire, in fact, that fleets of tankers are idling offshore near many of the world's largest oil hubs. We saw a preview of what this means just this week when oil prices fell to -$37 per barrel.

Because I follow these stories every day, that historic event almost felt like watching a train crash in slow motion. All of the signs were there - we all knew something bad was going to happen - though I don't think anyone imaged it would turn out quite like that.

But back to the topic at hand. Lockdown. Did you know that transportation of all sorts accounts for nearly 70 percent of oil consumption in the United States? And now, instead of sitting in traffic or jumping on the train to get to work every day, many of us just roll out of bed (shower optional) and hop on the computer.

Daily national traffic volume fell by roughly 38 percent from February 22-28th to the same days in March, and April is likely to be even more extreme. Worse still, this is the beginning of driving season, the time of year when families are supposed to hop in their car and drive out to see the great American countryside.

Now, of course, the lockdown is not the sole culprit in crude oil's demand crisis. But consider this, approximately 70 percent of each barrel of oil goes towards making fuel.

Before, about 5 percent of Americans had the luxury of being able to work from home. Now, more than 30 percent of the country is logging in from their couch instead of pouring up a to-go coffee and rushing out the door every morning. And though this lockdown has some of us clawing at the walls, desperate to go back to the office, or at least have some change in scenery, the cat is out of the bag.

Workers and companies alike now see that it's actually possible to be productive remotely. For employers, this means savings. Cheaper offices, no more mileage checks, no more stocking up on gallons upon gallons of coffee....you get the picture. For workers, well, for most, it means one thing and one thing only: no more commute.

Across the United States, the average time workers spend on their one-way commute is 27 minutes. That's 54 minutes every day... 4.5 hours per week...19.5 hours per month...234 hours per year. It's even worse for some of the country's biggest cities. In New York City, for instance, workers spend an average of 81 minutes on their round-trip commute.

Now, I can hear some of you yelling through your monitors ""MINE IS WAY WORSE."" Oh, believe me, I know how shocking these averages might seem to some of you. Back in Texas, myself and tens of thousands of others were stuck on the daily commute into Dallas which, on a lucky day, would take around 50-60 minutes, but had the potential to stretch into 1.5 or two hours or more rather easily.

By the way, that's just a portion of how much time Americans actually spend in their cars. We love our cars. In fact, there's an average of 1.37 cars owned per every American adult. More than that, we love to be in our cars. The average American, pre-crisis of course, spent more than 10 hours per week in their car.

So back to my original thought, what if ""when this is all over"" things don't just return to what they once were? The world is grappling with a (hopefully) once-in-a-lifetime crisis, and surely it won't be that easy for many people to simply dive right back into the mix, sitting in a small box for hours upon hours every week. So where will that leave oil?

We've heard ""lower for longer"" oil prices before...right before they jumped back up into the $60-70 range. But what if this is the real deal? Could COVID-19 potentially be a catalyst in a series of events that leads to peak oil demand? Or will demand recover to pre-crisis levels?"

Television and films about the French monarchy. It's time we moved on from Versailles to greener, more opulent pastures. For example, Imperial Russia's Winter Palace. Thanks to Hulu, we'll have the chance to explore the twists and turns of the Russian monarchy that led to the rise of famed monarch Catherine the Great in the new series, The Great.

The series is written by Oscar-nominated writer of The Favorite, Tony McNamara, which basically promises that the show will be a dark, deranged, and highly-entertaining satire. “I find period shows too polite on the whole,” he said in an interview with Vanity Fair ahead of the show's May 15 release. “They’re so drowned in their own historical facts.” Historians, look away! The Great will only bring the best semi-historical accuracy Hollywood can buy.

For those unfamiliar with the monarch, here's a brief one sentence history: Catherine became the country's longest-ruling female leader after organizing a coup d'état against her husband. “She was a young woman who took over an empire,"" explained McNamara. ""She kept the Enlightenment alive in Europe when it was dying. And she invented the roller coaster.” History buffs can confirm the latter statement as fact.

Elle Fanning stars as the Russian empress, and The Favorite actor Nicholas Hoult takes on the role of the haughty and ultimately doomed emperor, Peter III.

Kristi Noem on Thursday bemoaned Congress' restrictions on coronavirus relief funds allocated to the state, claiming ""they tied our hands"" to spend in areas that ""aren't really necessary.""",www.wral.com,"— South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem on Thursday bemoaned Congress' restrictions on coronavirus relief funds allocated to the state, claiming ""they tied our hands"" to spend in areas that ""aren't really necessary.""

""Congress did send South Dakota $1.25 billion to us, but they tied our hands on how we can spend it. The only way I can spend this money is on Covid relief. I can't spend it to replace revenues,"" she said at a news conference.

""I can't spend it to make up some of the difference that we're seeing from our economy stalling and people not out shopping and participating in adding some sales tax revenue to our state budget or to our local city and local government budgets as well.""

Her comments come on the heels of a stunning surge of coronavirus cases in South Dakota. Noem, a Republican, has faced criticism for refusing to issue a mandatory stay-at-home order, even following an outbreak at a major pork processing plant in the state.

Still, her calls for the state's federal relief funds to be allowed ""to replace revenue loss"" instead of funding ""a bunch of new government programs"" echo a growing desire among some Republicans to put an increased focus on halting more economic losses from the pandemic.

Governors in Georgia and South Carolina announced plans earlier this week to allow businesses to reopen in their states even as public health experts have repeatedly stressed the dangers of relaxing social distancing measures too early.

""You listen to members of Congress and the White House -- they say they don't want to bail out states that have been irresponsible,"" Noam said. ""I understand that.""

But, she assessed, South Dakota and other states that have ""made good decisions"" should have more freedom to spend relief funds as they see fit.

""It is not conservative to force a governor to spend money in areas that's not necessary and not allow me just to conduct business in a responsible manner that South Dakota always has,"" she explained.

""I need Congress to allow states like South Dakota that have made good decisions, wise decisions that have balanced our budgets to make sure that we have the flexibility to do what's responsible."""

Zoom stock popped after the company said its user base topped 300 million.

Chief Executive Eric Yuan in a webinar on Thursday said its user base reached 300 million on April 22, up from 200 million on April 1. Stay-at-home directives during the coronavirus pandemic have given a boost to Zoom stock.

Zoom shares jumped 12.5% to close at 169.09 on the stock market today. That topped the previous high of 164.94 set on March 23.

Zoom stock has a Relative Strength Rating of 99 out of a possible 99, according to IBD Stock Checkup.

Most of its new users download the free version of Zoom's software. Its paid subscriber growth isn't clear amid coronavirus emergency measures.

Zoom has added new security features to thwart hackers that have busted in on videoconferences.

They said patients may be unwilling to call 911 because they have heard hospitals are overwhelmed by coronavirus cases.

There’s growing evidence that Covid-19 infection can cause the blood to clot unnaturally, and stroke would be an expected consequence of that.

Dr. Thomas Oxley, a neurosurgeon at Mount Sinai Health System in New York, and colleagues gave details of five people they treated. All were under the age of 50, and all had either mild symptoms of Covid-19 infection or no symptoms at all.

“The virus seems to be causing increased clotting in the large arteries, leading to severe stroke,” Oxley told CNN.

“All tested positive. Two of them delayed calling an ambulance,” Oxley said.

It is not common for people so young to have strokes, especially strokes in the large vessels in the brain.

“For comparison, our service, over the previous 12 months, has treated on average 0.73 patients every 2 weeks under the age of 50 years with large vessel stroke,” the team wrote in a letter to the New England Journal of Medicine. That’s fewer than two people a month.

A stroke in a large blood vessel causes severe damage if it is not removed right away. At least one patient has died and others are in rehabilitation facilities, intensive care or in the stroke unit. Only one went home but will require intense care, Oxley said.

Oxley said his team wanted to tell people to watch themselves for symptoms of coronavirus infection and to call 911 if they have any evidence of stroke. “Up until now, people have been advised to only call for an ambulance with shortness of breath or high fever,” he wrote.

The easy memory device for stroke, he said, is “FAST”: F for face drooping, A for arm weakness, S for speech difficulty and T for time to call 911.

“The most effective treatment for large vessel stroke is clot retrieval, but this must be performed within 6 hours, and sometimes within 24 hours,” Oxley wrote."

New York, April 23, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Reportlinker.com announces the release of the report ""Europe Moringa Products Market to 2027 - Regional Analysis and Forecasts by Product ; Application, and Country"" - https://www.reportlinker.com/p05887365/?utm_source=GNW 

Moringa leaves possess several plant compounds with antioxidant properties.



In addition to beta-carotene and vitamin C, these include quercetin and chlorogenic acid; quercetin helps in lowering the blood pressure.Chlorogenic acid is another antioxidant found in moringa plant parts, which helps in moderating the blood sugar levels after meals.



Moringa products serve to be a vital source of many essential nutrients and antioxidants.Antioxidants are the compounds acting against free radicals in the body.



Higher levels of free radicals can lead to oxidative stress, which can be associated with chronic diseases such as heart diseases and type 2 diabetes. These products also help in reducing inflammation and lowering cholesterol levels in the body. However, it is unsafe to expose the pregnant women to the bark or roots of moringa. Chemicals in the bark, root, and flowers make the uterus contract, and this can possibly lead to miscarriages. There is no sufficient information available about the safety of consuming other parts of moringa during pregnancy.



The European moringa products market is still underdeveloped.Only an acute portion of European consumers know about moringa and its health benefits.



Therefore, awareness regarding the advantages and benefits of moringa is necessary among a significantly large portion of the population in the region. With increasing health-consciousness among the consumers, the demand for moringa products in the region is expected to continue to grow over the forecast period.



The European moringa products market has been segmented on the basis of product into leaf powder, tea, oil, seeds, and others.The leaf powder segment holds the largest share of the market.



The moringa leaf powder, made from naturally dried moringa leaves, is widely known to enhance the flavor of curries, soups, stews, salads, etc.The tea that is made from the leaves of moringa is a popular beverage with several foods, and drinks manufacturers are increasingly investing in this aspect.



The tea is rich in antioxidants, including polyphenols and other plant compounds; it proves effective in weight control.Moringa oil is rich in vitamin C and can be used in cooking; its high vitamin C content helps strengthen the immunity of consumers.



The moringa seeds possess anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. These seeds also help lower cholesterol levels, thus reducing the risk of heart disease; stabilize blood sugar levels; and enhance immune system. The others segment includes capsules and juices; moringa capsules are consumed as natural nutrient supplements.



The European moringa products market has been segmented on the basis of country into Germany, France, Italy, the UK, Russia, and Rest of Europe.Germany holds the largest share of the European moringa products market.



Consumers seek for various weight loss products which propel the demand for moringa products in Germany.Moringa products are also gaining popularity among the French people since the past few years.



The consumer base in France and Russia is expanding rapidly owing to widespread awareness regarding the importance of moringa products and their antioxidant properties.In Italy, these products are widely available at many food stores and online retail stores; thus, high level of awareness easy access to these products further boosts their sales in France, Russia, and Italy.



Obesity is also a major health concern in the UK. People who are overweight have a higher risk of getting chronic diseases and certain cancers. Therefore, the growing overweight population provides a huge opportunity for the moringa products market players to expand their reach in the UK. The increasing awareness and availability of moringa products among the rest of the European countries include Sweden, Poland, and Spain, along with the Nordic countries. Spain and Iceland have been rated among the healthiest countries in the world, by the Bloomberg Healthiest Country Index. The popularity of the Mediterranean diet among the people in Spain helps them to stay fit and healthy. However, rising awareness about antioxidant properties of moringa, constant growth in branding and marketing by retailers, and expansion of the cosmetic industry are the factors contributing to the moringa products market growth in the Rest of Europe.



Several players present in European moringa products market include Moringa Malawi, Kuli Kuli Inc., Organic India Private Limited and Earth Expo Company.



The overall European moringa products market size has been derived in accordance to both primary and secondary sources.To begin the research process exhaustive secondary research has been conducted using internal and external sources to obtain qualitative and quantitative information related to the market.

Greg Endres, with NDSU's Carrington Research Extension Center, said the university has been conducting field research during the past decade to examine the response of black, navy and pinto beans to selected combinations of row spacings and plant populations to identify optimum seed yield.

The research was conducted during 2014 to 2018 in eastern North Dakota with black and navy beans grown in reduced row spacing and with increased plant populations, according to a new release from the university’s extension office, compared with wide rows (28 to 30 inches) and the standard 90,000 plants/acre.
• Black bean seed yield averaged across four trials was similar among three row spacings of 14, 21 and 28 inches. Averaged across eight trials, yield increased slightly (less than 100 pounds per acre) with just fewer than 120,000 or 140,000 plants per acre, compared with yield with an average of slightly fewer than 100,000 plants per acre.
• Narrow (14-inch) rows with navy bean plant populations of 117,000 or 140,000 plants per acre increased yield 24% to 28%, respectively, compared with wide rows with slightly more than 90,000 plants per acre.

""Similar research work currently is in progress with pinto beans,"" Endres said. ""We are examining seed yield response with narrow rows and selected plant populations, compared with NDSU's long-term recommendation of establishing 70,000 pinto bean plants per acre in wide rows.""

The average pinto bean seed yield among four trials conducted in eastern North Dakota with 18-inch rows was 11% and 16% greater versus 12- and 30-inch rows, respectively, according to the news release.

In a series of five trials conducted at Carrington, pinto bean yield increased 18% with intermediate row spacing (21 to 22 inches), compared with wider rows.

Averaged across four pinto bean trials at Carrington and Minot, N.D., a plant population of slightly more than 70,000 plants per acre had a yield advantage of 6%, compared with 53,000 plants per acre.

Preliminary results with intermediate row spacing and plant populations near 90,000 plants per acre are indicating yield and economic advantages, compared with wide rows and the standard plant population.

Las Vegas Mayor Carolyn Goodman recounts what she did on Oct. 1, 2017, when 58 people were killed during the country's worst mass shooting while addressing the U.S. Conference of Mayors 86th annual Winter Meeting at the Capitol Hilton Jan. 25, 2018, in Washington, D.C. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)

(CNN) — The mayor of Las Vegas wants Sin City to reopen — but gaming industry workers, casino executives and Nevada’s governor beg to differ.

That’s why it’s unlikely that gamblers will be setting foot inside casinos on the glitzy Las Vegas Strip anytime soon.

In a testy interview with CNN’s Anderson Cooper Wednesday, Las Vegas mayor Carolyn Goodman repeatedly called for business to return to normal.

“I’d love everything open because we’ve had viruses for years that have been here,” she said at one point.

Goodman also criticized Cooper for showing a graphic from Chinese researchers that showed how easily the coronavirus can be spread in public.

“This isn’t China. This is Las Vegas, Nevada,” Goodman said, prompting a stunned Cooper to retort: “Wow. OK, that’s really ignorant.”

Goodman acknowledged she does not have the authority to reopen casinos or other businesses in the city. That call will come from Nevada governor Steve Sisolak.

And Sisolak is not rushing to get back to business as usual.

In an interview with Cooper after Goodman’s comments Wednesday, Sisolak said Nevada is “clearly not ready to reopen” and that he will not use Nevada as a “control group” for the rest of the country.

The Nevada Gaming Control Board issued strict guidelines earlier this week detailing the many steps that casinos will need to take before reopening.

And casino employees have also balked at the idea of returning to work.

“The mayor’s statements are outrageous considering essential frontline workers have been dealing with the consequences of this crisis firsthand,” said Geoconda Argüello-Kline, secretary-treasurer for the Culinary Workers Union, Local 226 in a statement.

“Health and safety is our priority. Workers and guests have to be safe,” she added.

Casino stocks have naturally been hit hard due to the Las Vegas shutdown. Shares of Caesars Entertainment have plunged 40% this year while Wynn Resorts and MGM Resorts have plummeted 45% and 60% respectively.

Las Vegas Sands, which owns the Venetian and Palazzo casinos on the Strip as well as the Sands Expo & Convention Center, has also suffered. Shares are down about 35% so far in 2020.

The company, which also has casinos in Macau, was the first of the major gaming firms to report results for the first quarter, saying late Wednesday that its global revenue plunged more than 50% from a year ago.

The numbers weren’t as bad as feared though. sparking a rally in Las Vegas Sands and other casino stocks Thursday. Las Vegas Sands surged nearly 10%.

The other major US casino companies will also likely discuss what’s happening in Las Vegas when they report their latest earnings in the next few weeks.

During a conference call with analysts, Las Vegas Sands president and COO Robert Glen Goldstein said he was optimistic that gamblers would flock back to Macau once casinos reopen there. But he was less enthusiastic about the possibility of a quick rebound in Las Vegas.

“I believe that from the bottom of my heart, the recovery in Asia is going to happen rather quickly. I’m not as comfortable in Vegas,” Goldstein said.

Goldstein pointed out that there are significant questions about when people will be willing to fly to Las Vegas and whether consumers will want to take vacations any time soon given how badly the economy has been hurt by the pandemic.

There’s also the issue of whether Americans will acclimate to stricter social distancing guidelines that will be required in the US once casinos eventually do reopen.

In Asia, many health and safety measures were already more common before the Covid-19 outbreak.

But Goldstein said it’s not clear how comfortable Americans will be about possibly needing to have their temperature checked and wearing masks and gloves before entering a casino.

“It is different. And I think it will be a little bit difficult here,” Goldstein said."

Emmerdale is a regular programme in many people’s homes, but not for one of its stars.

Eden Taylor-Draper confessed she doesn’t watch the soap often as she finds it ‘weird’ to see herself on TV.

The Belle Dingle actress told Inside Soap, “‘I don’t often watch myself on the show. I don’t watch Emmerdale every night, but I catch up when there’s big stuff, or I see clips on Twitter.”

“If I ever see myself, it’s weird. I don’t really associate it with me.”

Eden has been a regular member of the Emmerdale family since 2005. She first joined when she was eight years old.

Belle Dingle has seen plenty of gripping storylines, including the now iconic scene where she fell down a mineshaft.

As a result of this, she won ‘Spectacular Scene of the Year’ award at the 2006 British Soap Awards.

But despite not watching a lot of Emmerdale, Eden does enjoy spending time with her coworkers both on and off set.

“I hang out with Emma Atkins a lot between scenes, and also with Izzy Hodgins and Laura Norton – I share a dressing room with them, and we sometimes go out for dinner and things like that.”

“The most fun scenes to film are with people like Tony Audenshaw, because he’s just a legend! I also love scenes with James Hooton as Sam – he’s hilarious. Then I love it when Roxy Shahidi is in with Amy Walsh, because they’re just such a laugh together.”

Belle Dingle could see herself in big trouble during Friday’s episode of Emmerdale.

She discovers she’s booked the salon at the same time as Andrea (Anna Nightingale), the wife of her secret lover Jamie (Alexander Lincoln).

Things could potentially get awkward between Belle and Andrea!

Emmerdale continues every Monday, Wednesday and Friday at 7pm on ITV1."

Usually in an open market a bad actor is disqualified from future business dealings. Once a business partner demonstrates that he/she/it cannot be trusted or actively distorts the marketplace to gain an unfair advantage, that partner is usually cast aside.

Unfortunately, China has been a bad actor in business affairs for decades, well into three generations. It distorts capital investments, refuses reciprocal trade, manipulates its currency, manipulates markets (automotive and agriculture are prime examples) and exports illnesses that disrupt the global marketplace.

COVID-19 is not the first example.

SARS, the 1957 Asian flu, the 1968 Hong Kong flu and the 1977 Russian flu all originated in China and caused major worldwide economic disruption.

It should be a fair question to ask why the titans of American industry and finance continually embrace China as a trading, manufacturing and investment partner when it is unreliable and destructive.

Why have Apple, GM, Tesla, Nike, Under Armour, Walmart, medical supply firms (as we are experiencing all too graphically now) and others sold America out from under us, leaving us vulnerable and exposed? Is our national interest in destabilizing Russia as a major economic world power so great that we purposely prop up China? Probably not.

Before getting too indignant at governmental institutions for these failures, we should look at business leaders. How much greed is too much? That might be, probably should be, one of the lessons of COVID-19."

A total of 307 people have recovered from the virus and eight people have died in the country so far, according to the health ministry’s statement. 



Oman, like other Gulf countries, has been reporting a steady spike in the number of daily reported cases. However, Health Minister Dr. Ahmed Mohammed Obaid had warned earlier this month that that the cases would continue to rise.



“The cases are increasing, and we have not reached the peak,” he had said during a press conference.



Meanwhile, the ministry once again urged the public to adhere to precautionary measures like to continuously clean hands with water and soap, avoid touching the face, nose, mouth, and eyes, and follow healthy habits while sneezing and coughing.



It also called upon people to maintain social distancing practices to ensure the virus does not spread. — SG"

He was ...,www.theepochtimes.com,"College Student Became Homeless but Graduates With Psychology Degree Thanks to Caring Councilor

A young man is showing how poverty shouldn’t stand in the way of achieving your dreams. He was homeless when he began college and about to drop out. However, a meeting with a staff member changed everything. And now, he’s a graduate and looking towards the future with hope and ambition.

Caleb Simmons, from Oak Cliff, Texas, had just been admitted to the University of Northern Texas (UNT) in Dallas when he found himself in a rough patch. “We lost our house,” he recalled, according to NBC. “I had nowhere to stay. I had no car at the time.”

Due to not having anywhere to call home, the young man was struggling to keep up with his academic duties. “When I had no place to live, I would miss a lot of classes because I didn’t have any place to stay or any transportation. I was going to stop coming to college,” Simmons told CBS. Close to dropping out, he went to a staff member and explained his struggles.

That staff member was student solutions specialist Joann Chapin. “When I met Caleb, I could just tell he needed some assistance,” she said.

In a bid to help the young man, she got him in touch with another staff member, Luis Franco, director of undergraduate recruitment and admissions, who was able to accommodate him in his house. Franco became a long-term mentor for the student. “A lot of our staff members see a lot of these students as more than just a number, a face in the classroom or their office,” Franco explained. “We know that without addressing the whole student, and their whole situation, they’re not going to be successful.”​

The bond between Chapin and Simmons grew into a long-term friendship. “He’s definitely like a son to me,” she stated. He spent holidays with her family. And when dorm rooms became available, she helped him secure a place.

Thanks to the help he received from Chapin and other faculty members, the young man graduated from UTN with a degree in psychology in December 2019. He was even invited to give the commencement speech to his class. Simmons invited Chapin to the graduation to sit in the family section. “I’m proud to get to sit in his family section, and me and my kids get to sit there and watch him, graduate,” she said. He added, “If she wouldn’t have been here I probably wouldn’t be here.”

Armed with his degree, Simmons aspires to seek employment at the university as a student recruiter and help bring his entire family out of poverty. “By breaking it, I mean erasing it, there will be no poverty in my family,” he shared​.

In spite of his background, the young man said he has strong confidence in himself and his abilities, which others may interpret as big-headedness. “I tell them, ‘No, the reason I’m like this is because of what I’ve been through.’ I’m extremely proud of myself,” he said.

“No matter how much poverty, or unfortunate circumstances a person can be put in, they can still make a better life for themselves. Opportunities can happen if you go for them,” Simmons said."

Michelle Lujan Grisham’s administration continues to send a high volume of supplemental personal protective equipment to state and local entities like cities, counties, tribes, pueblos, state agencies, elder care facilities, health care clinics and more in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The state has aggressively and proactively pursued hundreds of orders for personal protective equipment in recent weeks, buttressing shipments from the federal strategic national stockpile. This equipment is needed not only in hospitals and health care settings but for first responders and others on the front-lines of fighting the pandemic and supporting the state’s cohesive containment and transmission mitigation efforts.

As of Sunday, April 19, the state had shipped 618 total orders of personal protective equipment to counties, emergency responders, shelters, regional medical centers, pueblos and more. The state has distributed 460,915 pairs of exam gloves; 38,160 face shields; 55,686 gowns; 98,880 N95 masks; and 281,080 surgical masks. Over the past weekend alone, the state made shipments to the city of Albuquerque’s emergency operations center, the city of Santa Fe, Los Alamos County, Dona Ana County, McKinley County fire and emergency services, Rio Rancho fire services, Pojoaque Pueblo, Zuni Pueblo, Santa Clara Pueblo as well as residential care facilities, nursing homes and senior living facilities in Bernalillo, Sandoval and Socorro counties, with dozens of more orders pending or ready for shipment.

Local entities make personal protective equipment requests of the state’s Emergency Operations Center through their respective emergency managers.

These distributions are in addition to the state’s work in conjunction with hospitals to ensure those health care entities have personal protective equipment for front-line health workers treating patients. The Governor’s Office and Department of Health are actively contacting hospitals to get accurate assessments of their personal protective equipment levels; the state then distributes from its equipment to those entities based on need.

“The state of New Mexico has been and will continue to be a proactive partner with entities all across the state as we battle this pandemic,” Gov. Lujan Grisham said. “We are leaning in unequivocally. It goes beyond the work we’ve done with our partners at hospitals and health care facilities all across the state; we’ve provided and will continue to provide PPE to cities and counties and pueblos and all manner of entities who request and need it. Because we are immensely grateful to our first responders and the helpers every single day. If they’re not protected, we’re not protected. And we will do everything in our power to keep it that way.”

Additionally, the state, through its Aging and Long-Term Services Department, has been working with the New Mexico Health Care and the New Mexico Home Health and Hospital Associations to provide supplemental PPE to all nursing homes, home health agencies, hospice and assisted living facilities across the state. As of Sunday, more than 100 providers have received the state-supplemented PPE, including more than 1,000 surgical masks, 2,000 pairs of gloves and 1,000 face shields. The state Department of Health COVID-19 Provider Portal has been enhanced to allow long-term care facilities to enter quantities of both their personal protective equipment as well as bed capacities. The portal also collects daily equipment use and burn rates to more accurately address the personal protective needs of the facilities."
620,620,https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2020/apr/22/spokane-county-leaders-will-follow-statewide-dista/,Spokane County leaders will follow statewide distancing orders as some in state push back,"While at least one sheriff and several county commissioners in the state have pushed back against Gov. Jay Inslee’s stay-home order, calling it unconstitutional and refusing to enforce it, Spokane County’s leaders intend to keep following the order.",www.spokesman.com,"While at least one sheriff and several county commissioners in the state have pushed back against Gov. Jay Inslee’s stay-home order, calling it unconstitutional and refusing to enforce it, Spokane County’s leaders intend to keep following the order.

Snohomish County Sheriff Adam Fortney posted on Facebook Tuesday evening that his department will not enforce the order he said inhibits religious freedom and constitutional rights.

In a vote Tuesday evening, Franklin County Commissioners also called the order unconstitutional, saying they supported the re-opening of small businesses and construction.

Spokane County Commissioners say they won’t follow Franklin County’s lead because they don’t want to give their constituents false hope about the prospect of change and open those citizens up to legal action from the state.

“If we pass a resolution that says businesses can open up, it’s essentially an empty promise,” said Spokane County Commissioner Josh Kerns. “It won’t protect them from the state taking action against them.”

Kerns said the governor has threatened legal action against businesses that ignore the stay-home order, and a vote from county commissioners won’t change that.

Inslee and Attorney General Bob Ferguson vowed Wednesday to resist local efforts to overturn the state’s emergency orders.

“We really cannot equivocate on this point,” Inslee said at a news conference. “We cannot have individual law enforcement officers decide arbitrarily which laws they are going to enforce and which laws they are not going to enforce.”

In a joint statement, Inslee and Ferguson criticized the Franklin County commissioners’ “open for business resolution” and Fortney’s announcement he would not enforce laws that keep many businesses closed.

Such actions are “misleading business owners and individuals in their jurisdictions, putting people’s health at risk and potentially putting them on the wrong side of the law,” Inslee and Ferguson said.

Franklin County commissioners don’t have the legal authority to rescind the statewide emergency orders, Inslee said. Only the courts can do that.

“People are entitled to their opinion. What they’re not entitled to is to be the ultimate decider of the Constitution,” Inslee said at the news conference. “No court anywhere in this state or federally has said this order contravenes the Constitution.”

He said the state will follow a three-step process for achieving compliance with the orders, which was announced when they were first issued.

First, state or local officials would contact them to educate them about the law. If they remained open, they could lose their business license. The final step would be legal action.

The vast majority of state residents and businesses are following the orders, he said. So far only one business faces legal action for violating any of the emergency orders, a California-based property rental company that threatened to evict tenants despite the state’s moratorium on evictions during the pandemic.

In the letter, Kathryn Leathers, Inslee’s general counsel, told commissioners to “retract or rescind” the open-for-business resolution adopted Tuesday “and any relevant guidance that purports to supersede state enforcement authority.”

Robert Koch, chair of the Franklin County Board of Commissioners, said over the phone Wednesday he and other commissioners will meet with the prosecuting attorney Thursday to discuss their resolution. He said he could not comment on whether they planned to rescind it.

Spokane County Commissioner Mary Kuney said she and local mayors have continued to advocate for their communities and urged the governor to reconsider his moratorium on construction. But she said they do not have the authority to attempt to re-open the county’s economy on their own.

Both she and Kerns said they had taken an oath of office to uphold the Constitution and did not plan to violate that.

Commissioner Al French said the county plans to work with the governor’s office and other elected officials to open the county’s economy legally.

“We’re not going to do anything illegal or get any of us in a position where we’re in a battle with the state,” he said.

While Sheriff Ozzie Knezovich said he doesn’t agree with Inslee’s approach to the stay-home order and closure of nonessential businesses, he won’t disregard it. He said those who believe it’s unconstitutional should file an injunction in court instead of leading protests or refusing to comply.

He said deputies are “appealing to the community spirit” and educating people they encounter to get them to voluntarily comply with the order.

“I’m not going to arrest anybody over this unless they want to be blatantly stupid about this,” he said.

Knezovich said he did not plan to shut down protests because doing so could violate participants’ constitutional rights, but he said people should take note if elected leaders or candidates for office are leading those protests and should hold them accountable on Election Day.

Knezovich pointed to state Rep. Matt Shea, of Spokane Valley, as an example of a politician who should work through the courts, rather than with protests, to oppose state closure orders.

Shea and Tim Eyman, a Republican candidate for governor, participated in protests against the measures Wednesday in Spokane."

As India’s ambassador to Kuwait, a couple of weeks ago, I addressed you through a written communication on the embassy’s website, and also circulated by other print media. As things continued to evolve, I have felt I should address you again. I am aware that all of us have been going through difficult times. But difficult times are times to show courage, stay calm and resilient, and not to panic. In this effort, all of us in the Indian Embassy are with you; and I am confident that together we will fight through this, and will come out triumphant.

The most encouraging fact is that we are living in a very friendly country; Kuwait is known for its humanity and generosity. I would like to thank the Kuwaiti government for taking care of all its residents during these troubled times, including the large Indian community. The government and the health authorities of Kuwait have taken commendable steps to control the spread of the virus. I must compliment all of you for already complying with various guidelines. I once again call upon you to continue to stand by the Kuwaiti authorities in implementing the curfew, staying at home, and reporting any suspected cases immediately.

I am also aware that there is considerable need for food or groceries etc among many members of the community who may have lost their jobs and have no savings. I am grateful to various Indian associations and several community members as well as volunteers, who have either already been reaching out to the needy, or have come forward to help.

Helpline numbers have been displayed on the embassy website. Please contact us or your nearest volunteer, so that the embassy can ensure that help reaches you. Please also allow me to convey sincere appreciation to the Indian Doctors Forum and other individual Indian doctors who have voluntarily been providing medical advice and counseling. You can approach them on the contacts provided, or through the embassy, or an Indian association.

And finally dear friends, the embassy is well aware that thousands of you are keen to return to India – there are beneficiaries of amnesty, workers who have lost their jobs, those on visit visas and others needing urgent medical consultation and treatment back in India. Please be assured that the embassy is actively working both with the Kuwaiti government and the government of India on this matter.

The Indian government is sparing no effort to ensure that the process of repatriation is smooth and happens at the right time. It is in the interest of all of us. I urge you for your understanding, patience and calm assurance. Your health, your safety as well as your families’ safety, is of our utmost priority and concern.

Thank you and may God bless you."

The Louisiana Board of Regents that oversees higher education met online Wednesday to formally adopt policies implemented in response to the pandemic, such as setting admissions criteria after standardized tests were canceled. They also approved additional changes such as authorizing existing degree programs to be offered entirely online.

The Regents have established a Digital Inclusion Committee that will help prioritize spending of some of the CARES Act money to address “Louisiana’s well-established digital divide.” About 90 percent of students have engaged with the digital platforms needed for their coursework but many lack reliable access to high-speed internet, a committee survey found.

Strategies to address those concerns include using low-tech distance learning including recording lectures and printing packets for pickup. The Regents also are providing surplus laptops and a statewide map showing where to go to find free public wifi for “drive-in studying opportunities.”

“So far, these stop-gap measures have proven extremely successful and the survey gives us great hope that students are persisting and adapting,” Commissioner of Higher Education Kim Hunter Reed said. “We know our talent development imperative is not paused during a pandemic. In fact, it is amplified.”

(AP) – Arkansas’ governor said Wednesday said the state will ease its ban on elective surgeries during the coronavirus pandemic and will announce next week whether he’ll ease restrictions on other businesses.

Gov. Asa Hutchinson said the state will allow hospitals and clinics to resume some elective surgeries starting Monday. The state had ordered health providers to reschedule procedures that can be safely postponed.

State Health Secretary Dr. Nathaniel Smith said the providers will have to meet certain conditions for resuming the procedures, including requiring patients to be tested for the virus 48 hours before the procedure.

Hutchinson had previously said he hoped to begin lifting some restrictions on May 4. He said Wednesday that he will announce next week decisions on restaurants, gyms and barber shops. He said he will announce on May 4 whether to lift limits on places of worship and larger venues.

Health officials said the number of coronavirus cases reported to the state has risen to at least 2,276 people. The state cut its death count from 43 to 42 after officials removed a Missouri resident from its total."

But some people don’t even get symptoms. Recent studies suggest as many as 80 percent or more of those infected are “silent carriers”, showing no or very mild symptoms.

It seems children and young, healthy people are more likely to be asymptomatic.

But to calculate the true proportions of people who have no symptoms right through to severe illness, testing would need to be expanded across whole populations, and this hasn’t been feasible yet.

We don’t know exactly why some people with coronavirus are asymptomatic while others develop life-threatening illness. But here’s what we know so far.

What happens when coronavirus enters your body?

Like all viruses, SARS-CoV-2 needs to get inside human cells to multiply and survive.

To do this, a particle on the outer shell of the virus latches onto a matching protein receptor, called ACE2, like a lock and key. ACE2 receptors are normally found in the lungs, kidneys, heart and the gut.

Once a person has been infected with the virus, it can take up to 14 days for symptoms to appear (if they do at all) – known as the incubation period.

The path from the point of infection can vary enormously. The body’s immune system is critical for determining this.

Having a strong immune response during the incubation period can prevent the infection taking hold, reduce the actual quantity of virus in the body and prevent it from getting to the lungs.

Our immune system offers us two lines of defense against viruses.

The first is the innate system and includes physical barriers such as skin and mucous membranes (the lining of the throat and nose), various proteins and molecules found in tissues, as well as some of the white blood cells that attack invading organisms. This immune response is general, non-specific and kicks in quickly.

Children have immature immune systems, but one hypothesis to explain why they don’t seem to get as sick with COVID-19 is that their innate immune response to coronavirus is greater than in adults.

This may lead to a reduced viral load – the quantity of virus particles that survive in the body – because they’re able to clear the virus more quickly.

The second line of defense is the adaptive immune response. This takes longer to initiate but once established, is much more efficient at eradicating a specific infection when encountering it again.

It’s thought that very specific genetic variations in some people might play a part in how sick they get. By generating an early adaptive immune response, the body seems to recognize the virus during the incubation period and fight it off.

A person also needs to be generally healthy to be able to mount an appropriate immune response to the infection.

After the incubation period, what determines how sick you get?

If the SARS-CoV-2 virus survives beyond the point of entry to the body (nose, eyes, throat) it might then make its way down the respiratory tract into the lungs.

In the lungs, it latches onto ACE2 receptors and continues replicating itself, triggering further immune responses to clean out infected cells. The amount of virus that gets deep into the lungs may be another important factor determining how sick you get.

As the battle between virus and immune responses proceeds, infected airway linings produce large amounts of fluid that fill the air sacs, leaving less room for transferring oxygen into the bloodstream and removing carbon dioxide.

Symptoms of pneumonia appear, such as fever, cough with sputum (phlegm) and shortness of breath.

For some people, the immune response is excessive or prolonged and causes what’s known as a “cytokine storm”. Cytokines are a group of proteins that send signals to cells in the immune system, helping direct the response.

A cytokine storm is a catastrophic overreaction that causes so much inflammation and organ damage, it can be fatal.

In people with COVID-19, as well as the previous SARS and MERS coronaviruses, this causes acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), when fluid builds up in the lungs. This is the most common cause of death from SARS-CoV-2.

Elderly people and those with chronic lung disorders are more likely to develop ARDS and therefore to die. This is currently thought to be due to these groups of people having fewer ACE2 receptors in their lungs.

This seems counter-intuitive, because the virus attaches itself to these receptors. However, ACE2 receptors have an important role in regulating the immune response, particularly in managing the degree of inflammation.

So the reduced levels of ACE2 receptors in the elderly may actually make them more at risk of a cytokine storm and severe lung disease.

Conversely, children have more ACE2 receptors in their lungs which might explain why they do not get as sick.

In some cases, medications that work to suppress the immune system have successfully treated this excessive immune response in people with COVID-19.

Can people without symptoms pass it on?

Some studies have indicated people with COVID-19 tend to have a high viral load just before and shortly after they start getting symptoms.

This suggests they can transmit it when they first get sick and up to 48 hours before, while they’re pre-symptomatic.

However, there is no good evidence that asymptomatic people who never develop symptoms are able to pass it on.

Researchers and clinicians are working around the clock to understand the complex relationship between humans’ immune systems and SARS-CoV-2 but it remains very much a work in progress.

628,628,https://www.lifehacker.com.au/2020/04/can-coronavirus-spread-4-metres/,Can Coronavirus Spread 4 Metres?,"Recent headlines have suggested COVID-19 can spread up to four metres, drawing into question the current advice to maintain 1.5 metres between people to prevent the spread of the virus....",www.lifehacker.com.au,"Recent headlines have suggested COVID-19 can spread up to four metres, drawing into question the current advice to maintain 1.5 metres between people to prevent the spread of the virus.

The news was based on a study conducted in Wuhan, China, and published in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases.

Meanwhile, a review published last week in the Journal of Infectious Diseases has concluded respiratory droplets, which may carry the virus, can travel up to eight metres.

So what can we make of these findings? And should we really be standing much further apart than we’ve been told?

First, how does coronavirus spread?

Coronavirus spreads through droplets when a person with COVID-19 coughs, sneezes or talks.

This means it can spread during close contact between an infected and uninfected person, when it’s inhaled, or enters the body via the eyes, mouth or nose.

Infection can also occur when an uninfected person touches a surface contaminated with these droplets, and then touches their face.

Some respiratory pathogens can also transmit through the air, when tiny particles, or aerosols, hang around.

Aerosols can be generated through coughing and sneezing, and sometimes from breathing and talking.

We know some infectious diseases like measles can be transmitted this way. But we need more research to understand to what degree this could be true for COVID-19.

Aerosols containing viruses like SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, are more likely to be generated through hospital procedures such as intubation and manual ventilation.

This may go some way to explaining the results of the four metres study, which took place in a hospital. Let’s take a look at the research.

What the study did

The researchers conducted their experiments in an intensive care unit (ICU) and general ward, both of which were looking after patients with COVID-19.

Over 12 days, the researchers collected swab samples four hours after the morning clean from floors, bins, air outlets, computer mice, bed rails, personal protective equipment and patient masks.

To determine whether aerosolised particles containing SARS-CoV-2 were present in the air, the researchers also took samples upstream and downstream of the air flow in both wards.

What did they find?

They detected SARS-CoV-2 widely on hospital surfaces and frequently touched hospital equipment. The ICU had a greater amount of virus than the general ward.

Most swabs, including computer mice and doorknobs, were positive for the virus. The highest virus concentrations were found on the floor, likely from virus-containing droplets falling to the ground. People then tracked the virus to the hospital pharmacy, presumably on the soles of their shoes.

The study looked at possible transmission through aerosol particles in the ICU by taking samples from three sites. Two sites were along the direction of the airflow, about one metre away from patients’ beds. One site was further away, approximately four metres from a patient’s bed and against the airflow.

Virus was detected in 35.7% (5/14) of samples taken near air outlets, and 44.4% (8/18) of samples in a patient’s cubicle. At the site located against the airflow – four metres away from the patient’s bed – virus was detected in 12.5% (1/8) of samples.

Although virus was detected in air samples from the general ward, the numbers of positive samples were fewer. Studies have shown people with less severe disease shed less of the virus, so this may be why.

How should we interpret the results?

We should consider the results from this study with caution. The study tests for the presence of the virus on surfaces and in the air, but doesn’t indicate if the virus was living and infectious.

The authors didn’t describe the nature of medical procedures undertaken in these wards, particularly if any might be likely to generate aerosols.

The virus sample detected four metres away was described as a “weak positive”. Both “intense positive” and “weak positive” samples were grouped together as positive samples in the results without defining what a “positive sample” was or explaining the distinction between the two outcomes.

The study had a small sample size and importantly, researchers didn’t use any statistical tests to determine the significance of their findings. So the results have limited utility in the real world.

What does this all mean?

The study adds to the evidence SARS-CoV-2 can be detected on surfaces.

But the finding that the virus could spread four metres is less convincing. Even if we disregard the study’s limitations, evidence of SARS-CoV-2 in the air isn’t evidence it’s infectious in that form.

The review assessed horizontal distance travelled by droplets from ten experimental and modelling studies. It found evidence droplets could travel beyond two metres, even up to eight metres using physical science experiments.

Of the ten studies, five were conducted using human subjects. These studies looked at the dynamics of droplet transmission but were not specifically related to SARS-CoV-2-containing droplets.

So we need more research to better understand transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in hospital settings.

Health-care settings should adopt measures to prevent airborne transmission, such as using N95 respirators and gowns, if conducting any aerosol generating procedures.

But in the community, we’d encourage everyone to continue to practise the recommended physical distancing measures of staying 1.5 metres away from others.

For many Latinos, Biden's embrace of the Obama years is a frightening reminder of when the former president ejected about 3 million people living in the U.S. illegally, earning him the moniker of “deporter in chief.”

That's one reason Latinos overwhelmingly backed Bernie Sanders during the Democratic primary. But with the Vermont senator out of the race and Biden left as the presumptive Democratic nominee, Latinos face an agonizing choice. They could look past Biden’s resume and vote for him or sit out the election and risk another four years of President Donald Trump, who escalated his hard-line stance this week with an executive order freezing some immigration into the U.S. during the coronavirus pandemic.

“The ‘Let’s go back to how things were’ for people who feel like they have a boot on their neck, it’s not always that compelling,” said Marisa Franco, director and co-founder of the Latino activist group Mijente, which made its first-ever endorsement when it backed Sanders for president.

The record number of deportations under Obama came as his administration sought to show it was serious about enforcement while waiting on Congress to approve an overhaul to the immigration system. But in the process, it deported a large percentage of people without criminal records, even while publicly saying its priority was removing criminals from the country.

Obama eventually gave up on Congress and changed tactics, extending temporary legal protections to young immigrants through Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, which is still being challenged in federal court.

Biden long defended the administration’s immigration policy, even telling one activist in South Carolina who decried deportations, “You should vote for Trump.” But just before losing the caucuses in heavily Hispanic Nevada in February, Biden conceded, “We took far too long to get it right.”

“I think it was a big mistake,” Biden said.

Domingo Garcia, president of the League of United Latin American Citizens, said some “in the more liberal side of the Latino community” view the issue as a “litmus test that’s something they’ve not forgotten.” But he said many activists see it as paling in comparison to Trump’s race baiting.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., a leading progressive voice, has said she'll vote for Biden in November even as she's said he needs to pay close attention to Latino issues. Sanders has endorsed Biden and called on his base of loyal supporters to rally around the former vice president to ensure Trump's defeat.

The Republican president isn't toning down his approach to the issue of immigration, viewing it as a way to motivate his base. Trump's latest executive order likely guarantees immigration will remain in the spotlight heading into the election.

The Trump administration deported about 267,260 people in fiscal year 2019, well below the single-year record of nearly 410,000 the Obama administration set in 2012. But Trump has increased the number of people jailed in the U.S. awaiting immigration court proceedings while sending around 60,000 back to Mexico while they wait for the same.

“Our community definitely understands and knows the consequences of having Trump as president,"" said Laura Jiménez, the Biden campaign’s Latino engagement director. ""This election is about our lives, our safety, our ability to thrive and be in this country and be accepted.“

About 32 million Hispanics will be eligible to vote in November, accounting for 13.3% of the electorate, outpacing African Americans to become the largest minority voting bloc for the first time, according to the Pew Research Center.

Biden's campaign has increased the budget for Latino outreach efforts. He has called into Hispanic radio shows and held weekly “Todos Con Biden,” or “All With Biden,” calls to engage Hispanic supporters. Lately, those have focused on speaking to Hispanic elected officials in states around the country about the fallout from the coronavirus.

In recent weeks, the campaign has begun using more nuanced approaches to target Latinos from an array of backgrounds since Cuban Americans have different concerns than those with ancestral roots in places such as Mexico, Puerto Rico or Venezuela.

Biden will soon begin vetting potential running mates who will likely include prominent Latinas such as Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico and Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada.

Still, the former vice president has not backed decriminalizing illegal border crossings, an issue on which he split from rivals including Sanders and former Obama administration housing chief Julián Castro during the primary.

Hispanics also represent a high number of uninsured Americans, meaning Sanders’ support for universal health coverage under “Medicare for All” appealed to many — another issue Biden hasn’t embraced. Younger Latinos tend to be major supporters of sweeping initiatives to fight climate change, which Sanders backed and Biden didn't.

Since Sanders exited the race, his chief Hispanic strategist, Chuck Rocha, has launched a political action committee aiming to motivate Latino voters up and down the ballot, especially in battleground states like Pennsylvania. Rocha said that he had not spoken to the Biden campaign about Hispanic outreach but that such initiatives need to be well funded and start now, not mere weeks before the election when they can feel superficial.

“You do it with the same percentage of the budget that you spend talking to that white swing voter that voted for Donald Trump,"" Rocha said. “Democrats and progressives need to understand that there’s way more untapped potential in engaging a Latino infrequent voter."""

Ramadan, a month of daytime fasting, overnight festivity and communal prayer and giving, begins with the new moon this week, and comes amid worldwide debate over when and how to lift virus restrictions. Keeping the faithful healthy during the entire month poses a whole new challenge.

The virus has already disrupted Christianity’s Holy Week, Passover, the Muslim hajj pilgrimage and other major religious events.

“Ramadan is coming, and people have nothing to eat,” said Afghan daily laborer Hamayoon, who goes by only one name. “The government must have some mercy on us and allow people to work at least half a day to be able to feed themselves.”

U.S. President Donald Trump is pushing for a swift nationwide reopening, Vietnam and New Zealand moved Thursday to end their lockdowns and European leaders were gathering via video Thursday to try to reinvigorate their virus-crippled economies.

The coronavirus crisis is far from over, however, and the threat of new outbreaks looms large.

“The question is not whether there will be a second wave,” Dr. Hans Kluge, the head of the World Health Organization’s Europe office, said Thursday. “The question is whether we will take into account the biggest lessons so far.”

German Chancellor Angela Merkel criticized some German states Thursday for moving too briskly in trying to reopen their economies. Germany has been praised for its proactive approach to the pandemic and has a much lower reported death toll than other large European nations.

Dr. Robert Redfield on Wednesday said he wanted to clarify a previous quote he gave to The Washington Post. Redfield said that in his quote he meant to say that a second coronavirus wave — if occurring at the same time as the seasonal flu — was not ""worse"" but instead ""more difficult.""

“We’re not living in the final phase of the pandemic, but still at the beginning,” Merkel warned. “Let us not squander what we have achieved and risk a setback. It would be a shame if premature hope ultimately punishes us all.”

Governments are bearing that risk in mind as Muslim leaders announce the official start of Ramadan, trying to balance health protection with traditions. Many have closed mosques or banned collective evening prayers.

In addition to Ramadan’s sunrise-to-sunset fast, families and friends gather for large festive meals at dusk, worshippers go to mosques for hours of evening prayers and communal meals are held for the poor.

Authorities in the capital of Indonesia, the world’s most populous Muslim majority nation, on Thursday extended to May 22 its strict disease-fighting restrictions — covering the whole holy month. Turkey banned communal eating during the holiday, and Albanian Muslim leaders urged the faithful to spend more time teaching their children about Islam.

Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan bowed to the country’s religious clerics, refusing to close the mosques despite a warning from the Pakistan Medical Association that such gatherings are like a petri dish to spread the virus in a country that has a fragile health care system.

Egypt’s Grand Mufti Shawki Allam said healthy Muslims have a religious obligation to fast despite the global pandemic — but added that coronavirus patients would be “most eligible” for an exemption.

A Bosnian Muslim makeup artist scheduled her daily food market visit at the same time as her father, so they could see each other from a safe distance while buying for fast-breaking Ramadan feasts.

U.S. authorities have also struggled to reconcile religious freedom with stemming the virus. A federal judge plans to deny a bid by three Southern California churches to hold in-person church services during the pandemic, saying government’s emergency powers trump what in normal times would be fundamental constitutional rights.

U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged Muslims to “focus on our common enemy — the virus,” and repeated an appeal for an immediate cease-fire for all conflicts.

The U.N. also warned that more than 135 million people were at acute risk of starvation even before COVID-19 appeared and the virus is making that situation worse. Massive lines have appeared for food banks from the Texas city of El Paso to the Paris suburbs, and food scarcities were hitting Africa especially hard.

“On one hand, the lockdown and lack of jobs. And on the other hand, Ramadan is coming and the prices for all food items have gone up. It is a huge problem,” shopkeeper Noor Alam lamented in the Afghan capital of Kabul.

The EU has pledged 20 billion euros ($22 billion) to help vulnerable communities globally. EU leaders were holding a virtual summit Thursday to take stock of the damage the coronavirus has inflicted on the bloc’s own citizens and to thrash out an economic rescue plan.

Dmitry Yakukhny, a Russian distance runner, completed a 100-kilometer (62-mile) run around his bed during lockdown as a way of encouraging everyone to exercise during the coronavirus outbreak.

Meanwhile, scientists are reporting new signs that the virus was circulating in countries earlier than initially thought.

Two people with coronavirus died in California as much as three weeks before the U.S. reported its first death from the disease in late February. On Thursday, a new genetic study published by Spain’s main epidemiology research center suggested that the virus was spreading in the country in mid-February, weeks before the first local contagion clusters were identified.

In China, authorities reported no new deaths and just 10 new cases on Thursday.

Chinese officials bristled at calls for an independent investigation into the origins of the outbreak, and pledged new money to help WHO fight the virus. The moves come after Trump announced plans to suspend U.S. funding to WHO over criticism of its relationship with China.

Coronavirus Deaths in Your City and State — and Across the US

These charts use daily coronavirus death data from Johns Hopkins University to show the seven-day moving average of deaths at the city, state and country level.

The impact of coronavirus varies enormously in the United States from one place to another.

The coronavirus has infected more than 2.6 million people and killed over 184,000, including more than 45,000 in the United States, according to a tally compiled by John Hopkins University from official government figures. The true numbers are undoubtedly far higher.

While most people suffer from only mild or moderate symptoms, the elderly and the infirm have been hardest hit by the virus. The WHO's Kluge said Thursday that up to half of Europe's 115,000 confirmed coronavirus deaths have been in nursing homes.

Kluge said a “deeply concerning picture” was emerging of the impact of COVID-19 on long-term homes for the elderly, where care has “often been notoriously neglected.” Kluge said health workers in such facilities were often overworked and underpaid and called for them to be given more protective gear and support.

To help people in Belgium’s capital bear the stress of their coronavirus lockdowns, a “love bus” is traveling the streets and broadcasting personal voice messages to those stuck at home.

“We miss you a lot. Big kisses!” trumpeted one message to 82-year-old Asuncion Mendez from her great-grandchildren. As Mendez looked out from her Brussels balcony, a huge smile spread across her face.

While we eagerly await extended-range revolution in country music, there is a 7-string guitar for all styles in this guide. The story of the 7-string is one of bold evolutionary leaps, and its Big Bang moment arrived in 1990 with the launch of Steve Vai’s signature Ibanez Universe. It took the Ibanez RG Series template and ran with it, introducing a seventh string that could be tuned to B in standard tuning, lower if you wanted to further poke your tone into your bassist’s domain.

The possibilities were huge, but it remained a niche instrument until the mid’-‘90s nu-metal boom and the later Meshuggah-inspired djent scene. Now, a 7-string is a ubiquitous presence in guitar stores and online, with the likes of Ibanez, Jackson, ESP/LTD and others offering some of the best 7-string guitars at all price points. Now, let’s see if we can find one that’s right for you…

What is the best 7-string guitar right now?

If we are looking for a 7-string to cover a wide range of styles, one that is hugely playable, looks cool and takes the evolution of the instrument that bit further, we’d go for the Jackson Pro Series Dinky DK Modern Ash HT7. Introduced at NAMM 2020, it’s equipped with a pair of multi-voice Fishman Fluence humbucker that are truly devastating for low-end riffing, but also versatile enough to contest the notion that these are just guitars for metalheads. At $1,399.99, that’s a pretty decent price, too.

Alternatively, you could spend half that amount on a 7-string guitar that’s similarly state-of-the-art, the Cort KX500MS. It too has a swamp ash body, but with an eye-catching poplar top. Its multi-scale design offers the best of both worlds in terms of string tension, and a pair of active EMG 707 humbuckers seals the deal, making this guitar a low-end shred machine for not a lot of money.

Best 7-string guitars: everything you need to know

With the 7-string designed to accommodate low tunings, you want a guitar that has a nice and tight seventh string. Only then can you dig in with your riffs. To get around this, 7-string guitars will typically have a longer scale – the more distance between the nut and bridge the more tension there is in the string to bring it up to pick. Here, we would be looking at a Fender-esque 25.5” as a minimum.

Some guitar designs, such as that of the Cort KX500MS and Jackson’s X Series SLAT7, use multi-scale formats, where the high E string has a regular 25.5” scale and the low B string, where you want it to be tighter, has a longer 27” scale. These designs incorporate a slanted bridge with a sort of hybrid design of seven individual string saddles and fanned frets for enhanced intonation across the fretboard.

To further enhance your low-end adventures, high-output pickups can be a valuable asset. If you are playing a high-gain style, a set of active humbuckers can give you both the searing output and the all-important note clarity so your riffs need not turn to mush at the critical moment. You don’t necessarily need these, however, with 7-strings such as the PRS SE Mark Holcomb and the OG Ibanez Universe deploying passive Seymour Duncan and DiMarzio humbuckers respectively. Again, the 7-string need not be limited to the total-metal crew, and sometimes a more dynamic range will suit your playing style better. Dave Davidson of Revocation might agree there, too. His signature Jackson Warrior is pretty darn metal, but his signature DiMarzio’s are wound with dynamics in mind.

There are other ways in which the 7-string can subvert your expectations of them tonally. Some will feature coil-taps to offer singlecoil tones, others, such as Jackson’s DK Modern Ash HT7 and the LTD Stephen Carpenter SCT-607B, have multi-voiced pickups that let you toggle between voicings. And it’s not just premium instruments that can offer such range; the entry-level Ibanez Gio we have listed here has a smart five-way switching system that gets the most out of its humbucker pairing.

Finally, and this is perhaps most important (after all, pickups and hardware can be upgraded), the 7-string has to be comfortable. There is a fair degree of fretboard geography to orienteer before you get comfortable moving from six strings to seven, and the neck and fretboard radius can help here. The best 7-string guitars featured here are all hugely playable, most offering fat frets and compound-radius fretboards for an easy ride.

The best 7-string guitars available today

Street price: $1,399 | Body: Swamp ash | Neck: Maple/wenge, three-piece, bolt-on | Scale: 26.5” | Fingerboard: Ebony | Frets: 24, jumbo nickel | Pickups: 2x Fishman Fluence humbuckers (neck and bridge) | Controls: Volume, tone with push-pull coil-tap and voicings switch, 5-way selector | Hardware: Black, Floyd Rose 1000 Series 7-String Double-locking Recessed Tremolo | Left-handed: No | Finish: Baked Green, Baked Blue, Baked Red

Finish is really cool, but might split opinion

Jackson went all-in at this year’s NAMM show and introduced all kinds of shreddables for your pleasure, but the updates to its Dinky Series really take the cake – not least this sand-blasted, 7-string Super Strat, which sees the ever-popular Dinky body shape housing a pair of active Fishman Fluence humbuckers.

Oh, sure, the finish is way cool (PRS introduced some limited edition SE models, proving great minds do often think alike), but we’ve got to start with those pickups. They’ll handle all those bass-heavy riffs the djent kids love, but with the multi-voice functionality, accessed via the tone control’s coil-tap in positions one and five, allied to the singlecoil tones in positions two through four inclusive, this Dinky is one versatile tone machine.

Oh, and it plays great, too, with a neck profile that’s begging for a shredding, fat frets, flat fingerboard radius… Holy Moly! And when you factor in the compact Dinky body, it makes for one accommodating guitar, perfect for taking your 7-string game further.

Street price: $1,029 | Body: Mahogany with maple top and quilted maple veneer | Neck: Maple, set | Scale: 26.5” | Fingerboard: Ebony | Frets: 24 extra jumbo | Pickups: Seymour Duncan Alpha humbucker (neck), Seymour Duncan Omega humbucker (bridge) | Controls: Master volume, master tone (push/pull coil-split), 3-way blade pickup selector | Hardware: Chrome, PRS String-Through Plate style | Left-handed: No | Finish: Holcomb Burst, Satin Walnut (with maple top and walnut veneer)

It’s at the upper band of PRS’s SE price range

Despite PRS Guitars dipping its quilted-maple toe into the 7-string market circa 2013 with a super-sized SE Custom model, it was never going to be the company’s bread and butter. Every now and then, however, there comes along a guitar such as this, for a guitarist such as Mark Holcomb, and then it makes perfect sense.

We love this because of the refinement. Holcomb plays metal, and this signature PRS most-capably supports this enterprise, and yet it is all curves and chamfering, with no sharp edges that call out ostentatiously to the black T-shirt dollar.

There is a wealth of tone to be had here, with Holcomb’s smart pairing of Seymour Duncan’s passive Alpha and Omega humbuckers in the neck and bridge positions offering heaps of grunt, and a coil-tap on hand for some singlecoil sparkle. Excellent build, awesome tones, flawless finish… Another fine PRS. Hey, they should do this sort of thing more often.

Street price: $705 | Body: Swamp ash with poplar burl top | Neck: Maple/amaranth, five-piece bolt-on | Scale: multi-scale 25.5""-27"" | Fingerboard: Macassar ebony | Frets: 24 | Pickups: 2x EMG 707 (neck and bridge) | Controls: Volume, tone, 3-way selector | Hardware: Black nickel, individual hardtail bridge w/6 single saddles, Cort locking tuners | Left-handed: No | Finish: Star Dust Green, Star Dust Black

Multi-scale is not for everyone

The six-individual bridge design is not a feature peculiar to Cort but it’s nonetheless part of what makes the KX500MS such a good option for those looking for an accessibly priced 7-string that places intonation at the core of its appeal.

This drive for perfect pitch starts at the string’s journey at the six-individual saddles, arranged at an angle, and continues towards the nut across the fanned-fret fingerboard. This multi-scale idea is perfect for extended-range guitars, where you want a longer scale for the low B string to keep it tight for riffing while a Fender-esque 25.5” scale on the high E allows you to bend strings for leads. It’s the best of both worlds, so long as both those worlds are populated by chug-hungry metalheads, for the pair of super-hot active EMG-707 humbuckers are wound for the maximum destruction arising from high-gain and low-tunings. It’s fierce, but that’s the point, right?

Street price: $249.99 | Body: Poplar with quilted maple veneer | Neck: Maple, bolt-on | Scale: 26.5” | Fingerboard: Treated New Zealand pine | Frets: 24, jumbo | Pickups: 2x Infinity R humbuckers (neck and bridge) | Controls: Master volume, master tone, 5-way blade pickup selector | Hardware: F107 hard-tail bridge | Left-handed: No | Finish: Transparent Blue Burst, Transparent Black Burst

So you’re thinking about getting a 7-string guitar, and you’re on a strict budget? Well, there are options. You could go for a Jackson DS22-7 Dinky, which is pretty sweet, has a much nicer fingerboard, and plays great, but then the Gio’s GRG7 neck profile and its quilted maple veneer and transparent finishes just about edge it.

7-string neophytes will find the neck an easy ride, and the F107 hard-tail is a tidy piece of engineering.

This is one of the best 7-string guitars for beginners and would be worthwhile modding in time. Switching out the pickups for something a little hotter would be a fun project. As it is, though, you’ll find plenty of chug for the money.

Launch price: $3,399 | Body: Mahogany with flame maple top | Neck: Mahogany, neck-through | Scale: 25.5” | Fingerboard: Ebony | Frets: 24 | Pickups: DiMarzio Rainmaker-7 humbucker (neck) and DiMarzio Sonic-7 humbucker (Bridge) | Controls: Magnetic volume (push/push)/Magnetic Tone/Piezo Volume 3-Way Output Switch (Magnetic/both/Piezo)/3-Way Pickup Switch (Magnetic Pickups) | Hardware: Schaller locking tuners, Piezo-equipped floating vibrato, chrome | Left-handed: No | Finish: Enchanted Forest

Oh goodness, it is expensive

OK, the one percent need only apply, but what a guitar: this may well be the acme of 7-string superstrat design. Where do you start? Well, the construction, fit and feel is incredible.

The DiMarzio Rainmaker humbuckers coupled with its byzantine switching system offer a cornucopia of tones, metal and otherwise, while the built-in adjustable boost will help your solos cut through the mix.

The Piezo on is like the guitar equivalent of having monogrammed slippers and smoking jacket. It’s just classy. But it’s not just for show, and allows Petrucci some on-the-fly acoustic tones.

This entry-level Jackson might be a spartan instrument but as a gateway drug for the 7-string curious this is hard to beat. The jumbo frets reward a light touch while the Dinky’s body is always comfortable whether played seated or standing.

The JS22-7 would make a great fixer-upper – the most obvious mod would be a pickups upgrade. That said, the stock Jackson humbuckers deal well with thick distortion and won’t make a meal of your riffs.

The scale length helps keep that 7th string taut. And for a guitar at this price, the Dinky holds its tune.

Launch price: $1,299 | Body: Alder | Neck: Maple, through neck | Scale: 27” | Fingerboard: Ebony | Frets: 24 | Pickups: Fishman Fluence SRC Signature humbucker (neck and bridge) | Controls: Volume (with push/pull feature), tone, three-way pickup selector | Hardware: LTD locking tuners, Tonepros Locking TOM bridge | Left-handed: No | Finish: Green Sparkle

You might prefer Carpenter’s dope new S-style

We love the Green Sparkle finish and Tele vibe. But make no mistake: this, too, is geared towards metal, or at least situations when the gain is on high. The full baritone scale is a beast but tuning this down a whole step or a step-and-a-half won’t throw it out of whack.

The Fishman humbuckers are active but have a push/pull feature to toggle between their “modern passive” and “modern active” voicings. A nine-volt battery is hidden in the back and easily changed. The through-neck construction is another positive; this will sustain for days.

Street price: $1,299.99 | Body: Mahogany | Neck: Maple, through-neck | Scale: 25.5” | Fingerboard: Ebony with Alumiloid Piranha Teeth inlay | Frets: 24 jumbo nickel | Pickups: 2x DiMarzio Dave Davidson Imperium 7 humbuckers (bridge and neck) | Controls: master volume (push/pull coil-split), master tone, 3-way toggle pickup switch | Hardware: Black, Floyd Rose 1000 Series 7 Double-locking Recessed Tremolo | Left-handed: No | Finish: Natural Walnut

You could take someone’s eye out with Dave Davidson’s new signature 7-string, but maybe if you play death metal in a band named Revocation that is kind of the point. But seriously, the Warrior is one of Jackson’s most slept-on body shapes, and should be mentioned in the same conversation as the BC Rich Warlock or Jackson’s Rhoads asymmetric V bodies.

Here, Davidson has gone for a mahogany body and resisted the urge to overwhelm it with active pickups, preferring instead his signature Imperium humbuckers from DiMarzio. With a frequency output that emphasises the guitar’s midrange, they are pretty classically voiced, and offer a dynamic playing experience.

A Floyd Rose 1000 Series vibrato is on hand for saucing your lead playing with harmonic squeals and dive-bombs, and it’s a mighty fine unit.

Excellent value given the quality

Not the most metal guitar around

Now available in a very tasteful Satin Black, (the original was finished in Satin Sage Green as chosen by Angel Vivaldi’s fans), the NOVA is pretty much everything you’d look for in a hot-rodded Super Strat.

When Charvel draws up plans for a new guitar with an artist, nothing is off the table. There are some really cool signature flourishes here. Note the tilt-back headstock – this is the only Charvel to have one, and it is to enhance consistency in string tension.

A set of locking tuners does the job nicely in keeping everything in order, while the Gotoh vibrato is super-stable. Little touches such as the rolled edges on the fretboard just make for a supremely playable instrument.

Elsewhere, the Nova has a Charvel-branded reverse Stratocaster headstock and a modified Jackson Dinky body. Exactly the sort of inventive, witty guitar design that Charvel made its name in.

Street price: $1,499.99 | Body: American basswood | Neck: Maple/walnut five-piece Wizard-7, bolt-on with KTS Titanium rods | Scale: multiscale 25.5"" | Fingerboard: Bound Panga Panga with green dot inlay | Frets: 24 jumbo, Premium fret edge treatment | Pickups: 2x DiMarzio Blaze humbuckers (neck and bridge), DiMarzio Blaze singlecoil (middle) | Controls: Volume, tone, 5-way selector | Hardware: Cosmo black, Edge-Zero II-7 tremolo | Left-handed: No | Finish: Black

You need more super-powered output from the pickups

The Universe was definitely the guitar that started the extended-range craze, even if it took a while to catch on. Developed with Steve Vai, it was launched in 1990 and would become a game changer, an avant-garde Super Strat – and yet now much of its appeal lies in its retro cache.

The HSH pickup configuration and five-way switching offers such a wide variety of tones. This reissue is a great option for those who might feel the 7-string’s evolution was perfected first time out. It has DiMarzio Blaze pickups, which are passive but are pretty darn hot – after all, Vai loves a lot of gain and bringing it to heel is a big part of his style. The Wizard-7 neck profile is flat and wide, a solid bedrock for exploring the panga panga fretboard. Panga panga? Also known as wenge, a rosewood substitute and performs similarly.

Launch price: $1,199 | Body: Mahogany with maple cap | Neck: Mahogany | Scale: 25.5” | Fingerboard: Ebony | Frets: 24 | Pickups: EMG 60-7H humbucker (neck) and EMG 81-7H humbucker (bridge) | Controls: Two volume, tone, three-way pickup selector | Hardware: EverTune bridge, black | Left-handed: No | Finish: Black

Notable for being the only singlecut in our lineup, the EC-1007 is the Frankenstein offspring of ESP/LTD’s Eclipse series. The EverTune bridge is the sort of quality hardware the best 7-string guitars needs to maintain stable tuning.

With the slightly shorter 25.5” scale, the Eclipse brings some regular six-string feel to the extended range game.

Is there a more classic paring than an EMG 60 in the neck and EMG 81 in the bridge? These high-output active pickups will handle anything you throw at them, but they excel in high gain situations, delivering lethal metal rhythm tones imbued with an ever-so-slightly compressed quality."

The...,sputniknews.com,"The working committee of India’s primary opposition party, Congress, met via a videoconference on Thursday to discuss the implications of the lockdown on the economy.

The party chief pointed out several issues such as low testing, poor quality of testing kits, shortage of personal protective equipment, stranded, jobless migrant labourers, farmers facing difficulties in the absence of unclear procurement policies and disrupted supply chains.

The Indian government is yet to announce a stimulus package to revive the economy. Meanwhile, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has submitted its proposals for economic stimulus package to Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman.

Congress lawmaker Anand Sharma had earlier suggested that Prime Minister Narendra Modi should be bold in declaring an economic package of at least 5 to 6 percent of gross domestic product, which translates to between $98 and $117 billion.

On the lockdown, which has come with economic fallout, former Prime Minister D. Manmohan Singh said, “The success of the lockdown is to be judged finally on our ability to tackle COVID-19....Cooperation between the centre and states is the key to the success of our fight against COVID-19"".

The party members also raised concern about the situation in states under the lockdown.

The Indian economy was slowing down even before the pandemic. From 8.2 percent GDP growth in 2018, it fell to 4.7 percent in 2019. The International Monetary Fund has said that it will further come down to 1.9% this year."

We trade fish for pansies, visit each others’ pretty pink houses, and celebrate birthdays with parties and presents. All of this happens inside Animal Crossing, the video game that is injecting some normalcy, calm, and connectedness into my lonely quarantine life with ADHD.”

When the stay-at-home orders hit, and people all over the country began hunkering down to wait out the worst of the crisis, I found myself alone in a way I had never expected. My roommate unexpectedly moved out in February, and for the first time in my life, I was living completely alone. Since I’m a homebody by nature, you’d think I’d relish having an apartment to myself. That might be the case under normal circumstances, but I wasn’t prepared for the loneliness of living alone during a pandemic — possibly exacerbated by my symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity (ADHD) and rejection sensitive dysphoria (RSD).

I found myself craving a social life and, thanks to a VoIP (voice over internet protocol) software service known as Discord, I was able to interact socially online. Originally created to give the gaming community an easy way to chat and text, Discord makes it possible to connect in real-time with people you invite to your channel. (It’s similar to the way Slack works at the workplace.)

During the first week of lock down, while everyone else was binging Tiger King (sorry, but I just don’t get the appeal), I watched YouTube videos. When that got old, I started texting friends, but no one was responding. What was going on? It turns out everyone — but me — was playing Animal Crossing: New Horizons, a 2020 Nintendo Switch game.

Though this latest version of the game, initially released in 2001, was one of the most highly anticipated releases this year, it sounded dull to me so I never planned to buy it. Then the pandemic struck and I needed a distraction from the health crisis and all my related anxiety. Besides, my friends were all playing it and I missed them. Luckily, I’ve owned a Nintendo Switch for about two years; now they are about as hard to find as toilet paper!

Conquering Loneliness With A Little Help from My (Virtual) “Friends”

What’s so special about Animal Crossing? Video games have long been an effective anxiety reducer for my busy ADHD brain since they help me relax by distracting both my hands and my mind. (When I’m anxious, it’s more difficult to curb the anxiety if my hands aren’t occupied.) I find this particular game so engaging it prevents me from hyper-focusing on all the bad news happening in the world right now.

But perhaps most surprising is that the game offers a unique social experience that I didn’t know I needed. Another condition I live with is RSD which makes me extremely sensitive to criticism and rejection. Animal Crossing isn’t competitive so there is no need to worry that I’m dragging the team down. By sharing in-game resources with my friends, I can help them achieve what they want. It’s an online way for me to be generous.

The game involves buying real estate from a cute tanuki, a Japanese raccoon dog avatar (remember Nintendo is a Japanese company), named Tom Nook. (Note the bad pun — the game’s full of them, but to me that’s part of its charm!) Don’t worry; here you can easily get interest-free loans! With that real estate, you build your own fantasy island, where you get to live a simple, stress-free life surrounded by animals you invite to join you.

It’s fun to build and create houses through exchanges of commerce like fish and wood. Want to live in a pink house filled with flowers top to bottom like I do? Go for it! (I sold a rare species of fish I caught along the beaches of my island so I could buy dozens of pretty pansies. That’s virtual me fishing on the beach, below.)

[Could You Have Generalized Anxiety Disorder? Take This Self-Test Now]

In your fictional community, you can do normal things that feel like treats right now like buying clothing from the beloved Able Sisters shop. Bug catching is another popular and, for me, therapeutic activity. One of my favorite past times, though, is digging for fossils to display in the museum on my island. A scholarly, bug-averse owl named Blathers is the curator and always happy to tell you about the fossils you dig up.

The soothing background music and artistic graphics are other calming features. The meteor showers (see screenshot, top of post, with my conscientious friends donning their face masks on a recent visit to my island) are perhaps the most impressive. Look out for shooting stars because when you see one you get to make a wish!

Initially, I thought I’d play the game solo, but my friends and I play nearly every night after work or school. We visit each other’s island communities and help each other decorate our homes. There’s even a way to give them in-game gifts — handy when birthdays take place in real life.

Since there are no losers in the game, Animal Crossing is more relaxing than competitive options like Fortnite or Overwatch where one team wins and another one loses. In Animal Crossing, you’re never punished for doing things at your own pace, and mistakes are very easy to correct.

The game has a reward system, but there are no levels to achieve; no enemies to conquer. This type of game is known as a sandbox, meaning you can do whatever you want, whenever you want, for as long as you want. You just play at your own pace. All the villagers are your friends —bullies are simply not an option — which makes for a very happy dwelling place.

Not Your Typical Way to Tie the Knot

Social distancing is triggering cancellations — and heartbreak — across the nation. But some couples refuse to let the virus ruin their plans. Animal Crossing has become the digital destination venue for several weddings. Birthday celebrations are happening there as well. And now that the end of the school year is approaching, graduation celebrations are being scheduled, too. It’s not as romantic or celebratory, I suppose, but I think it may be a good way to give some importance to the event or at least create an unusual memory.

It’s a game that has something for everyone. And did I mention that wishes made in Animal Crossing come true? My wish is for normalcy to return to our lives soon, but in the meantime, I wish you the joy and social connection you likely need right now. We can all use a little help from our friends — even if they are funny animal islanders!

The Latest on the coronavirus pandemic. The new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms for most people. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness or death.

— China didn’t warn public of likely pandemic for 6 key days.

— Amazon threatens to suspend activity in France over virus protection ruling.

— Health police in Italy say 15 nursing homes were closed because they posed a grave threat to the elderly.

ROME — The scientific director of Italy’s leading infectious disease hospital has written to the Italian president formally suggesting that Dr. Anthony Fauci be invited to work here if U.S. President Donald Trump removes him from the White House conronavirus task force.

In the letter released Wednesday, Dr. Giuseppe Ippolito of Rome’s Lazzaro Spallanzani hospital says removing Fauci from the task force “would be disastrous news not only for the United States, but for the whole international community.”

Ippolito praised Fauci’s expertise, experience, leadership and “generous and selfless help” to Spallanzani and other hospitals around the world.

Speculation about Fauci’s fate swirled over the weekend after Fauci told CNN the U.S. would have “obviously” saved lives if virus mitigation efforts had begun earlier.

Trump responded by reposting a tweet that included the line, “Time to #FireFauci.” But on Monday, Trump insisted Fauci’s job was safe.

DUBAI — Emirates Air says it tested the blood of passengers for the virus on a flight to Tunisia before departing from Dubai, becoming the first airline to conduct on-site rapid tests for passengers.

The blood test was conducted by Dubai’s health authority with results available within 10 minutes, according to the airline. Passengers were tested upon check-in at the gate in Dubai’s international airport.

Passengers are required to wear their own masks when at the airport in Dubai. The emirate has imposed a 24-hour curfew on residents for at least two weeks to contain the virus.

There are multiple drive-through testing centers in Abu Dhabi and Dubai, where people are encouraged to get tested even if they do not have COVID-19 symptoms.

BERLIN — Germany is extending border checks until May 4 due to the coronavirus.

Interior Ministry spokesman Bjoern Gruenewaelder announced the temporary measures. The controls were introduced a month ago to ensure only people with “good reason” entered Germany.

Normally, there are no border checks in Europe’s passport-free Schengen travel area. The affected borders are those with Austria, Switzerland, France, Luxembourg and Denmark, as well as for airport arrivals from Italy and Spain.

Also, patrols have been stepped up in the frontier regions with Belgium and the Netherlands.

PARIS — Amazon threatened to suspend all activity in France after a French court found it wasn’t doing enough to protect its workers.

The online giant also announced plans to appeal Tuesday’s emergency ruling, which requires Amazon to stop selling nonessential goods for a month while it works out new worker safety measures.

Sales of food, medicine and hygiene supplies are still allowed under the ruling. However, Amazon France says the decision is so disruptive that it could prompt the company to suspend all activity at its six French warehouses.

The company stressed the importance of its services to the “thousands of French companies that sell on Amazon” and “millions of people around the country who want to have access to products they need during the crisis.”

Amazon insisted it is providing adequate security measures for staff, noting the implementation of temperature checks and mask distribution.

But the court found Amazon didn’t do enough to enforce social distancing, to ensure that turnstiles and locker rooms were virus-free or to increase cleaning of its warehouses. Unions say one worker infected with the virus is in intensive care.

ROME — Italy’s health police say 100 of some 600 Italian nursing homes inspected since February aren’t up to norm, amid reports of hundreds of elderly people dying in facilities across the country amid the coronavirus pandemic.

The carabinieri police’s health squad issued a detailed rundown of their virus-related inspections on Wednesday. They reported that 15 facilities were closed outright because they posed such a grave threat to the elderly, and their residents moved elsewhere. It said 61 people were reported to judicial authorities, while another 157 were fined for infractions including lack of safety norms at the facility, and lack of protective equipment and training for staff.

Italian prosecutors have launched criminal investigations into at least a dozen nursing homes, following reports that elderly were abandoned or left unprotected from the virus.

In the biggest case, concerning the 1,000-bed Pio Albergho Trivulzio facility in Milan, staff complained that management prohibited doctors and nurses from wearing protective masks, for fear of alarming residents. The facility has insisted it followed all security protocols and says it is cooperating with the investigation.

NAIROBI, Kenya — The Inspector General says police will arrest those found not wearing masks in public places, vehicles and private cars.

Kenya’s government had published the law last week which slaps a fine of $200 for anyone found not wearing a mask in public as a preventative measure against the spread of the coronavirus.

Hillary Mutyambai says the grace period for people to acquire and get used to wearing masks is over and police will take action. He was speaking to journalists Wednesday.

CANBERRA, Australia — Several Australian police recruits face losing their jobs for holding a party in breach of social distancing rules.

Australian Federal Police Commissioner Reece Kershaw told reporters on Wednesday that “a number of officers” had been served with notices to explain why they should not be fired over the noisy party at a residential training college in Canberra on April 3.

Australian Broadcasting Corp. cited an unnamed police source saying 14 recruits could be fired.

Alcohol had been banned from the college since neighbors complained about the party noise, ABC reported.

Australian social distancing rules require people to keep 1.5 meters (5 feet) apart and to move in groups no larger than two unless in the company of direct family members.

MILAN — Italians are showing a growing awareness of longer-term changes that will be mandated by the virus, while concern grows over economic well-being as the nationwide lockdown continues, at least through May 4.

More than half of Italians are concerned that someone in their family will lose work because of the virus — a figure that has held steady for three straight weeks — with concern over the spread of the virus has dropped from 51% last week to 46% this week, according to the SWG polling agency.

The lessening of worry comes as the number of cases narrows, and pressure on hospitals eases.

At the same time, half of Italians say the virus crisis will last more than three months — a complete turnaround from March 11 when 72% were convinced the crisis would be over inside of 90 days.

Now two-thirds say that in six months, the virus will not be completely eradicated and “we will have to change our habits and behaviors in a definitive manner,” the survey found.

Eighty-five percent agree with the lockdown — a slight erosion from 91% a month ago.

The survey is based on a sample of 2,800 adults.

BRUSSELS — The European Union says US President Trump has “no reason” to freeze World Health Organization funding at this critical stage and called for measures to promote unity instead of division.

EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said that the 27-nation group “deeply” regrets the suspension of funds and the WHO is now “needed more than ever” to combat the pandemic.

Borrell said that “only by joining forces can we overcome this crisis that knows no borders.”

Even though the group has been traditional allies with the U.S. for decades, the EU has increasingly been critical of the Trump administration over the past years.

BEIJING — A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman says the country is “seriously concerned” about the U.S. government’s decision to suspend payment to the World Health Organization.

“As the most authoritative and professional international institution in the field of global public health security, the WHO plays an irreplaceable role in responding to the global public health crisis,” ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told reporters at a daily briefing on Wednesday.

President Donald Trump said Tuesday that he was cutting off U.S. payments to the organization, accusing it of failing to do enough to stop the virus from spreading when it first surfaced in China.

“The WHO failed in its basic duty and must be held accountable,” Trump said at a briefing, adding that the U.S. would be reviewing the WHO’s actions to stop the virus before making any decision on resuming aid.

China wields major influence in the WHO, allowing it to elect its favored candidate Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus as director-general, blunt any criticism and block participation by rival Taiwan.

Zhao said the U.S. decision will “weaken the WHO’s capabilities and undermine international cooperation in fighting the epidemic. It will affect all countries in the world, including the US, especially those vulnerable to crisis.”

MADRID — Spain has recorded 523 new deaths attributed to the coronavirus in the past 24 hours while infections shot up again for the first time in five days.

Wednesday’s new 5,092 infections, or a 3% day-to-day increase, brought the total of confirmed cases to 177,633. The country’s overall death toll stood at 18,579, the world’s third-worst after the United States and Italy, Health Ministry data showed.

Spain has eased this week the conditions of Europe’s strictest lockdown, allowing manufacturing, construction and other nonessential activity in an attempt to cushion the economic impact of the pandemic.

The International Monetary Fund is forecasting a sharp recession for Spain this year, with its 1.2-trillion-euro (1.3-trillion-dollar) gross domestic product expected to shrink by 8% and unemployment to increase from 14% to 21% before a slow recovery in 2021.

Amid sharp criticism for its handling of the coronavirus crisis, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez on Wednesday told lawmakers that the government’s measures have worked in slowing down the spread of the virus and called for political unity to launch the country’s “rebuilding.”

WELLINGTON, New Zealand — New Zealand police have been working with some creative folks on a series of humorous videos about life in lockdown.

There’s the one about those awkward Zoom meetings, complete with the person who can’t figure out the sound, the one who turns into a donut thanks to a random screen filter and the one whose partner walks past in pajamas.

There is another video featuring a song about keeping a distance of two meters please because “I don’t want your covid if you start to sneeze.”

Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern’s partner Clarke Gayford even appears on one of the videos, a little crazed after baking too much bread.

BEIJING — The U.S. ambassador to China says he doesn’t believe Beijing is deliberately blocking exports of personal protective equipment and medical supplies, adding that the shipment of 1,200 tons of such products to the U.S. could not have been possible without Chinese support.

Terry Branstad also told a small group of reporters on Wednesday that the U.S. has concerns about how China initially handled the virus outbreak in the central city of Wuhan, but that such issues should be addressed after the worldwide pandemic has been brought under control.

“Let’s focus now on saving lives and helping people,” Branstad said.

Chinese officials are believed to have delayed reporting the outbreak for several crucial days in January due to political concerns, allowing the virus to spread much further than it potentially may have.

China has adamantly denied such actions, despite strong evidence to the contrary, saying it has all along been providing accurate, timely information.

Despite working at half staff, U.S. diplomats and local staff in China have been able to facilitate 21 flights of supplies on behalf of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, along with the multiple private chartered flights, Branstad said. Despite reports of separate U.S. states and foreign governments competing for masks, gowns and other needed equipment, he said the Beijing embassy and various consulates have made strenuous efforts to fulfill all requests.

CANBERRA, Australia — The Australian prime minister says he sympathizes with President Donald Trump’s criticisms of the World Health Organization, but Australia will not stop funding the United Nations’ agency.

Trump has directed his administration to freeze WHO funding, claiming the agency didn’t deliver adequate early reports on the coronavirus and cost the U.S. valuable response time.

Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison told Perth Radio 6PR on Wednesday: “I sympathize with his criticisms and I’ve made a few of my own.”

Australia had announced that COVID-19 had become a pandemic weeks before WHO did. Morrison says WHO’s support for Chinese wet markets where the virus is thought to have transferred from an animal to humans is “completely mystifying.”

“WHO is also as an organisation does a lot of important work, including here in our own region in the Pacific, and we work closely with them so that we’re not going to throw the baby out with the bathwater here,” Morrison said. “But they’re also not immune from criticism and immune from doing things better.”

WHO’s special COVID-19 envoy David Nabarro has since toughened the organization’s line on wet markets, telling the BBC “there are real dangers in these kinds of environments.”

HELSINKI — The Finnish government says it will end the blockade of a key southern region that includes the Nordic nation’s capital, Helsinki, in the first move of easing COVID-19 -related restrictions.

Justice Minister Anna-Maja Henriksson said Wednesday the government found no legal justification to further continue blocking movement of citizens into and out the Uusimaa region, a restriction which enter into force on March 28.

The Uusimaa region is home to some 1.7 million people, nearly of third of Finland’s population, including Helsinki’s 650,000 residents. The region has been the worst affected by the pandemic and the lockdown was meant to prevent the spreading of virus to rest of the nation.

Prime Minister Sanna Marin stressed that all other coronavirus-related restrictions would remain in place in Finland including a ban on gatherings and closure of schools. Finland has so far recorded 64 deaths and 3,237 confirmed COVID-19 cases.

LONDON — The British government is promising to test thousands of nursing home residents and staff for the new coronavirus, as it faces criticism for failing to count care-home deaths in its tally of victims.

The government says it will begin to routinely test care workers and will also test any residents who show symptoms. Currently only the first five symptomatic residents of a home are tested to determine whether there is an outbreak.

British officials are under fire for failing to conduct more tests for COVID-19. The government has promised to change that and has set a target of 100,000 tests a day by the end of April, a more than five-fold increase.

Charities have accused the government of treating elderly people like they don’t matter, and social-care operators say the new coronavirus is causing “devastation” in the country’s nursing homes.

Official statistics showed Tuesday that 15% more people with COVID-19 have died than were recorded in the U.K. government’s daily tally of hospital deaths — including hundreds in care homes.

Disinfect hard surfaces. When you get to your seat and your hands are clean, use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest, the seatbelt buckle, the remote, screen, seat back pocket and the tray table. If the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather, you can wipe that down, too. (Using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them.)"

So what does this mean for you and your pets?

Two pet cats in New York state tested positive for the new coronavirus this week, marking the first time a pet in the United States has tested positive for COVID-19.

Following the news, many viewers reached out to VERIFY with their questions. So we tackled some of your most common questions about your furry family members and coronavirus.

Is it possible my pets could further spread the disease? Are my pets in danger? Is testing pets using possible tests for people?

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention currently advises that there is no evidence that pets play a significant role in spreading the coronavirus. Still, they urge you to exercise caution when taking care of your pet amidst this pandemic.

Both of the cats in question had mild cases and are recovering, according to officials. There are currently no cases of an animal having severe COVID-19 symptoms.

The USDA says both cats were from New York state, although they were from different parts of the state and their illnesses were unrelated. Both of them have mild respiratory symptoms but both are expected to make a full recovery.

The owner of one cat had COVID-19 prior to the cat showing signs of illness while no one in the other cat’s household has had the illness yet. The USDA said it’s possible the cat got the illness from an asymptomatic carrier in the house or contact with an infected person outside the home.

Originally, the CDC stated that pets were unlikely to be at risk of getting COVID-19 because they had no evidence of pets getting the disease. The CDC now advises that you treat pets like you would humans in your household -- don’t let them come in close contact with strangers and keep people diagnosed with COVID-19 away from pets.

The CDC also added that the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to humans is low “based on the limited information available to date.” They say there is no evidence pets play a significant role in spreading the virus.

So far, four animals in the U.S. have tested positive for COVID-19, according to the USDA’s list. All four have been felines in the state of New York. The first confirmed case involved a tiger in a New York zoo and the second was a lion also in a New York zoo.

In the agency's animal testing FAQ, the USDA explained tests for animals use reagents not required for human COVID-19 tests and thus should not reduce the availability of tests for people. The tests are performed by veterinarians instead of doctors.

So, what are some big takeaways from all of this? Yes, your pet can get COVID-19 so you should avoid cuddling it if you’re sick and you shouldn’t let strangers pet it for the time being. So far, all pets with coronavirus have had mild symptoms and testing these animals has not impacted human testing at all."
646,646,https://chicago.suntimes.com/education/2020/4/22/21231768/cps-digital-computers-divide-remote-learning-public-schools,"CPS buys 16,000 more computers than planned to help bridge digital divide, but says some devices won’t arrive till May","More than 50,000 Chicago Public Schools students still need computers five weeks after in-person classes shut down because of the coronavirus.",chicago.suntimes.com,"More than 50,000 Chicago Public Schools students still need computers five weeks after in-person classes shut down because of the coronavirus, leaving one in seven kids unable to access online educational materials as the second week of remote learning forges ahead.

Efforts have been underway for weeks to bridge that technological divide, but the process has been a slow churn.

CPS officials said at a virtual Board of Education meeting Wednesday that almost 55,000 devices had been handed out by the middle of this week, with another 6,400 given out at charter schools. That leaves a wide gap, as CPS has estimated 115,000 students need a computer, and likely a similar amount need access to the internet.

Almost all the devices distributed so far were among 65,000 that were already in schools and are expected to be handed out over the next week.

CPS has separately purchased 53,000 additional devices, up from an initial pledge to buy 37,000 once a greater need was determined. Those include 31,300 Chromebooks, 16,700 iPads and 5,000 Windows laptops. About 43,000 of those computers have arrived and are being sent out this week to 155 schools that have been selected to receive the first batch. The rest aren’t expected to come until sometime in May.

Board of Education members were briefed on details of the anticipated spending on the devices and other COVID-19 response costs not yet shared with the public, which apparently included about $16.5 million on technology or about half the $32 million the pandemic has so far cost the schools system. For instance, CPS planned to spend $6.5 million on 25,000 Chromebooks, $2.5 million on 6,000 iPads and $4.8 million on Windows-based laptops.

The district also set up an IT hotline for families receiving the devices. Almost 1,500 requests were fielded last week, most of which have been serviced already.

“This is a problem that has existed before this crisis,” CPS Chief Information Officer Phil DiBartolo said during the second Board of Ed meeting to be streamed live online.

“I would be derelict if I told you every student who needed access is going to get it,” DiBartolo said. “There is no finish line here and we are going to push as hard as we can push.”

Internet access is an even more difficult problem to navigate, DiBartolo said.

So far, CPS has offered 12,000 mobile hotspot devices to the district’s students experiencing homelessness. For the rest, officials have pointed to internet providers who are offering 60 days of free services to families in need.

But families have faced barriers to signing up for those programs, such as a lack of information, nonexistent credit history, no social security number for undocumented residents or fear of having a worker enter their home during a public health emergency to set up the service.

So advocates and families have called on CPS to offer more hotspots, but DiBartolo said that’s a challenge because CPS doesn’t have the same number of existing mobile hotspot devices as it did computers. Almost the entirety of the 115,000 internet devices needed would have to be purchased, and those resources simply aren’t available, he said.

The reasons for that shortage include last year’s tariff war between the United States and China and reduced manufacturing in China during the COVID-19 pandemic, he said. And even with production picking up in China as the country starts to reopen, the first internet devices that arrive in the United States will likely go to hospitals and first responders, who will be the priority.

For those reasons, Board of Education President Miguel del Valle called on city and state leaders to urge internet providers to contribute more resources to helping families in need.

“We need the private sector to give more than what they’ve given so far,” del Valle said.

“ ... I urge the city and the state to strongly encourage these internet service providers to service our families so that we don’t end up with students that will never have access to the internet at home because of the inability to qualify or to follow whatever steps of procedures are required.”"

It’s true, and they do it very well. Formed from the ashes of various dead bands (too morbid?), FU is a rock ‘n’ roll Vulcan mind meld of longtime friends. Nick Cino (Lead Vocals, Guitar) and Dave Marini (Bass, Vocals) met in elementary school and have been songwriting collaborators since they learned how to play their first E-chord. They were soon joined by Jon Daly (Lead Guitar) and Adam Cannon (Drums, Vocals), who took things to the next level with their uncanny musical abilities. Throughout it all they’ve had one mission: write big, catchy rock songs with loud guitars, big drums, and soaring vocals. When playing venues throughout Canada, the US, and Europe, the band would often get told to “turn the guitars down”. Well screw that.

 

 Growing up on 90’s rock, Fool’s Union aren’t afraid to turn up the guitars a little more, belt the vocals out a little louder, and leave everyone with their ears ringing in the best way possible. The band is known for their love of groups like Foo Fighters, Oasis, Black Crowes, Biffy Clyro, Incubus and Weezer.

 

 After years of using bigger recording studios, the band pulled a George Lucas and went independent, using the money made from years of gigging to purchase their own recording equipment and set up a home studio. The freedom to write and record at their own pace and explore ideas resulted in five new singles which the band is unleashing on the world.

 

 Their 4th single, “Under The Thunder” is an epic rock ballad for the ages. The track is accompanied by a cheeky video about the love between a man and his puppet. “Under The Thunder” is the follow up to “Break Through”, “Safety Deposit Box”, and “Live Action”. The band is currently writing new material for a full length album."
648,648,https://www.spectator.com.au/2020/04/ad-infinitum/,Ad infinitum: 200 years of Spectator adverts show how little changes,A conventional hierarchy of print media would put serious journalism at the top. Far beneath that would be tabloid journalism. And then at the very bottom…,www.spectator.com.au,"A conventional hierarchy of print media would put serious journalism at the top. Far beneath that would be tabloid journalism. And then at the very bottom would be advertising.

Except, in one respect, I think that order should be reversed. Yesterday’s advertising is much more interesting than yesterday’s serious journalism.

I suspect this is because advertising, like tabloid journalism, reflects what people really care about — and always have done. Gossip. Sex. How to attract the opposite gender. What car to buy. Health complaints. Miracle cures. Death. Money. The Beckhams. The Windsors. The new 55in QLED 4K television. At last relief from embarrassing itching. Love Island’s Kaz Crossley displays her jaw-dropping figure in a black bikini as she dances in a shower while in Thailand. How else can a month’s salary last a lifetime?

Advertising and tabloid journalism — they’re the real thing. They are what everyone is truly interested in. Serious journalism, by contrast, covers what a small, self–appointed elite pretend to be interested in so as to appear sophisticated and au courant to each other. It’s often a duty read, done to avoid the fear of looking ill-informed.

Thomas Sowell once said that ‘Political activism is a way for useless people to feel important’. The same could be said for reading commentary on current affairs. Because when you look back across the sands of time, though 2 per cent of what is debated turns out to be of immense importance, the majority turns out to be astoundingly irrelevant. And it’s impossible to tell at the time which is the 2 per cent that actually matters. In the wider scheme of things, it is quite likely that Brexit turns out to be as irrelevant as the ground-nuts scandal, despite the gallons of ink spilled over it; by contrast the really game-changing stuff — such as admitting China to the World Health Organisation — barely aroused any comment at the time.

In terms of evolutionary psychology, serious journalism is tomorrow’s fish-and-chip paper, whereas advertising, like tabloid journalism, is as eternally relevant as the works of Shakespeare.

To commemorate the 10,000th edition of The Spectator, I looked at a cross-section of advertisements from 1828 to the present day. And whereas I suspect the accompanying content is mostly of interest only to historians of the Corn Laws and so forth, the advertising is endlessly fascinating.

How little changes! It was announced recently that McLaren and other Formula 1 companies are helping with the design of ventilators for the NHS. In 1914 it was Rolls-Royce advertising its contribution to the war effort. ‘The Admiralty and the War Office have, since the outbreak of hostilities, proved by their anxiety to obtain chassis constructed by the Derby Works that they share the confidence placed in the Rolls-Royce by private owners.’

I can imagine the copywriters back in 1914 having the same conversations we are having (by videolink) now. What do we do to respond to this crisis and avoid making our advertising look irrelevant? So: ‘No rise in the price of Lotus shoes — same now as before the war.’ (I think that is the maker of the Lotus Veldtschoen shoe, of which I still have a pair inherited from a great uncle; they still polish up a treat.) By 1916 Lotus were advertising field boots.

Some things are different. Glaxo — which today is the G of GSK, a FTSE company and the sixth largest pharmaceutical company in the world — advertises frequently, but with the slogan ‘Glaxo builds bonnie babies’. There is an obsession with knock-off imitations in the copy which you don’t see today. Lea & Perrins is particularly insistent that you ask for the product by its full name, a problem of the age before supermarkets when you would ask for ‘Worcester Sauce’ and the grocer would fob you off with his feeble imitation. There are other surprises too.

In my working life, I doubt I shall ever have the opportunity to end an ad with the sentence ‘charms away the feeling of fatigue, gives stamina, and convinces you that the end of the British Empire is not yet — not yet’. Nor will I ever be able to use a clergyman to promote tobacco, which ‘soothes the restless soul in a riotous age’. Nor advertise the virtues of moving to British Columbia on the grounds that ‘74 per cent of the population is of British origin’. I was surprised to see an ad for Madras Curry Paste from the early 19th century (our obsession with Indian food is older than I thought) and one for a newly published book by Jeremy Bentham (one shilling).

Hovis, Horlicks and Carr’s biscuits are there. Bovril, Boots, Colman’s, Fortnum’s, Cross & Blackwell (at the time a shop, not a manufacturer), Cadbury, Fry’s and a host of life-assurance companies which you would still recognise. But the most remarkable advertisement is an ad for The Spectator itself, from 1829, when it was one year old.

‘The tone and character of “THE SPECTATOR”, the variety of its contents, and even its external form, peculiarly fit it for the Use of respectable Families. Its Plan is entirely new, comprising:

1. The whole NEWS OF THE WEEK, so selected, sifted, condensed and arranged, as to be readable throughout.

2. A full and partial exhibition of all the leading POLITICS of the day.

3. A separate discussion of INTERESTING TOPICS of a general nature, with a view to Instruction and Entertainment at the same time.

4. A Department devoted to LITERATURE, consisting of Independent Criticisms on New Books, with Specimens of the best passages.

This Newspaper is especially recommended to the notice of English Families resident on the Continent.’

This is more or less an exact description of the magazine 9,950 issues later. (I like to think of the Wiki Man as an occasional purveyor of SCIENTIFICAL and Miscellaneous Information.)

What a perfect example of how the greatest brands endure unchanged. Like Lea & Perrins, when you have a winning formula, you shouldn’t change a thing."

Stage 1: Maryland will lift the stay at home order and allow the reopening of many small businesses. Other community activities that are low risk -- like recreational fishing and elective surgeries -- will resume. Local governments like individual counties can have the flexibility to open up other things, such as parks and playgrounds and libraries with safety protocols in place.

Stage 2: Will occur if there is no spike in deaths or sustained spike for ICU cases, as well as no additional significant community transmissions. This would include even more businesses reopening, and non-essential workers who can't rely on teleworking returning back to their jobs.

There would still be limits on social gatherings, but transit schedules like the Metro would return to normal. Indoor religious gatherings would be allowed with limited capacity, and restaurants and bars would be able to reopen with some safety protocols.

Stage 3: More ""high-risk"" activities like large social gatherings and high-capacity bars/restaurants would be allowed to open, loosening up restrictions on visits to other places like nursing homes and entertainment venues. Large scale religious gatherings would be allowed as well.

While the state has to see a continued trend in downward cases before it can begin the recovery plan, Gov. Hogan said he was hopeful of a soon start date thanks to aggressive actions from Marylanders.

""Fortunately, because of the early and aggressive actions and because of the extraordinary sacrifices of Marylanders, we are now in a position to move from containment and mitigation to planning the gradual rollout of our recovery phase,"" Governor Hogan said Friday. “There are some very real reasons for hope and optimism right now and there is clearly light at the end of this tunnel, but exactly how and when we will get to that light is going to be up to each and every one of us.""

The number of new cases in Maryland each day bounces up and down, while the total keeps climbing. But the governor says that's not the key measure. He's looking for 14 straight days of fewer deaths, fewer hospitalizations and fewer people transferred to intensive care.

The number of people admitted to hospitals and transferred to the ICU has also been uneven, but the trend line is up.

The state does continue to expand hospital capacity. The governor was touting the 135 new COVID-19 beds at the University of Maryland Laurel Regional Hospital. Hogan said the state has already surpassed its planned surge capacity, with 6,700 available beds, instead of the 6,000 that had been planned.

With the region locked down and the economy cratering, some states plan to reopen soon, but everyone is looking for a way to do that safely.

In addition to more hospital beds, Maryland wants more protective equipment, more testing capacity, and more people to trace the contacts of people who are positive for coronavirus.

State health officials said they currently have 250 people to conduct contact tracing and are looking to quadruple that. Those disease detectives may be crucial to getting us back to some semblance of normal.



The National Governor's Association, which Gov. Hogan heads, released its own roadmap to reopening Wednesday. It says the White House needs to dramatically boost testing and strengthen other public health measures first."

Michelle Barclay-Dunbar, from Oyne in Aberdeenshire, decided to use excess materials she had taking up space around her shed and garage to get creative while spending time in isolation.

Using old pallets, cable reels and more, Miss Barclay-Dunbar has built a home-schooling area, a bar, a DJ booth, a scarecrow and other eye-catching features for her garden.

Her seven-year-old son Brandyn has been enjoying playing on the makeshift pirate ship his mother made for him out of old pallets, complete with a slide and skull-and-crossbones flag.

Miss Barclay-Dunbar has encouraged others to have a look around their house and see what they can build to help pass the time, and learn some DIY skills at the same time.

She said: “It’s a little bit of escapism from what’s going on right now.

“I’ve always been keen on DIY and gardening, and realised I had loads and loads of pallets and things like that leftover.

“I had always wanted to build Brandyn a pirate ship, so that was my first project and there’s been loads more.”

Miss Barclay-Dunbar, who has previously competed in gardening competitions, hopes to welcome friends over to enjoy her creations once the lockdown has finished.

But in the meantime, she is keen to spread the word of the benefits of DIY work.

She added: “I’ve also made a sun lounging area that we’ve been able to use for home-schooling in the warmer weather, which is a very nice environment to work in, and then I’ve also made a bar too, with a DJ booth.

“Brandyn has been a super supervisor, making sure everything is working and he’s just absolutely over the moon with the pirate ship.

“He’s really excited for his first play date with it, whenever that may be somewhere in the future.

“I’ve already had a few friends get in contact and ask about the projects I’ve been doing, and they’ve been coming up with their own ideas too, so it’s been really fun.”"

The Christchurch-based powerhouse business owns the Shotover Jet near Queenstown, Franz Josef Glacier Guides, Rotorua's Agrodome and Rainbow Springs, the Dark Sky Project in Tekapo, and was establishing the All Black's Experience due to open in Auckland in mid-year in what was the SkyCity Convention Centre.

The impacts of Covid-19 and the lockdown had taken a significant toll on the tourism industry, from which Ngāi Tahu Tourism had not been immune, the company said in a statement.

The tourism attractions no longer had any revenue and even when the industry reestablished, it was expected to take a long time to recover, said Ngāi Tahu Holdings chief executive Mike Pohio and Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu Kaiwhakahaere Lisa Tumahai.

""Therefore, after robust analysis and discussions and with heavy hearts, we share with you our intention to close our tourism businesses for the time being. This difficult decision has also resulted in a proposal to significantly downsize our Ngāi Tahu Tourism workforce, with more than 300 kaimahi at all levels potentially losing their jobs as a result,"" they said.

After a full consultation period, a final decision will be made next month.

Proposing the moves was ""devastating for us – and certainly something we did not envisage a few months ago"".

The business was doing all it could to support those affected and was particularly proud of the whanaungatanga and manaakitanga on display across the organisation in such difficult circumstances, the statement said.

""At this time of challenge for our Ngāi Tahu Tourism kaimahi and our tourism operations, we are reminded of our gratitude for those who led our iwi through Te Kerēme and Settlement.

""Those who came before us have ensured that Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu has a diversified portfolio of business interests, including tourism, seafood, property, forestry, farming and capital investments. This careful and deliberate structure means that when these challenging times come, we can continue our important work of protecting and sustaining the pūtea for future generations,"" it said.

As the business was undergoing consultation with its kaimahi, it would not be making any further comment, the statement said.

Clutha-Southland MP Hamish Walker said the news was ""heart-breaking"".

""As one of our large employers here in Queenstown, to see staff lose their jobs is distressing for all involved.

""My heart goes out to all of the people involved, who like so many in our community are now facing even more uncertain times, with no income, "" Mr Walker said

Mr Walker said two out three people in Queenstown worked in the tourism sector and if there was not more Government support given soon, it was going to get ""far worse before it gets better"".

More large scale redundancies would come.

""It's why more needs to be done to support our businesses, so we can support our people in staying in work and getting through this tough time.

""I've spoken with dozens of businesses whose futures are all uncertain and unless they receive some support they will have to close their doors.

""It is trying times throughout New Zealand but Queenstown is by far the worst affected area."""

""Your feedback contributed to conversations with Cal OES about the real and growing needs for PPE in agriculture. As these conversations have progressed, we have been asked to provide more detailed information. ""

The latest survey comes as agricultural commissioners in 28 counties are hearing from farmers who are having trouble getting PPE for their employees and farmers in another 11 counties who are worried about running out of PPE in the next month or two, according to a previous California Department of Pesticide Regulation survey.

Gloves, N95 respirators, coveralls and other gear that workers wear to protect themselves from COVID-19, pesticides, dust and other health hazards are in short supply as priority is given to health care workers during the pandemic.

To reduce the spread of COVID-19, workers may wear homemade face coverings, but for applying pesticides, they must wear respirators specified on the pesticide product label, said Whitney Brim-DeForest, University of California Cooperative Extension rice advisor.

Pesticide applicators may use gear that is more protective than required by the product label and regulations.

“Although this could change in the days ahead, half-mask and full-mask respirators are more available than disposable N95 respirators for now,” UC Pesticide Safety Education Program coordinator Lisa Becker told UCANR's news service.

Within weeks of the disease's global emergence in February, governments around the world raced to build or buy ventilators as most hospitals said they were in critically short supply.",www.moneycontrol.com,"When he was diagnosed with COVID-19, Andre Bergmann knew exactly where he wanted to be treated: the Bethanien hospital lung clinic in Moers, near his home in northwestern Germany.

The clinic is known for its reluctance to put patients with breathing difficulties on mechanical ventilators - the kind that involve tubes down the throat.

The 48-year-old physician, father of two and aspiring triathlete worried that an invasive ventilator would be harmful. But soon after entering the clinic, Bergmann said, he struggled to breathe even with an oxygen mask, and felt so sick the ventilator seemed inevitable.

Even so, his doctors never put him on a machine that would breathe for him. A week later, he was well enough to go home.

Bergmann's case illustrates a shift on the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic, as doctors rethink when and how to use mechanical ventilators to treat severe sufferers of the disease - and in some cases whether to use them at all. While initially doctors packed intensive care units with intubated patients, now many are exploring other options.

Machines to help people breathe have become the major weapon for medics fighting COVID-19, which has so far killed more than 183,000 people. Within weeks of the disease's global emergence in February, governments around the world raced to build or buy ventilators as most hospitals said they were in critically short supply.

Germany has ordered 10,000 of them. Engineers from Britain to Uruguay are developing versions based on autos, vacuum cleaners or even windshield-wiper motors. US President Donald Trump's administration is spending $2.9 billion for nearly 190,000 ventilators. The US government has contracted with automakers such as General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co as well as medical device manufacturers, and full delivery is expected by the end of the year. Trump declared this week that the US was now ""the king of ventilators.""

However, as doctors get a better understanding of what COVID-19 does to the body, many say they have become more sparing with the equipment.

Reuters interviewed 30 doctors and medical professionals in countries including China, Italy, Spain, Germany and the United States, who have experience of dealing with COVID-19 patients. Nearly all agreed that ventilators are vitally important and have helped save lives. At the same time, many highlighted the risks from using the most invasive types of them - mechanical ventilators - too early or too frequently, or from non-specialists using them without proper training in overwhelmed hospitals.

Medical procedures have evolved in the pandemic as doctors better understand the disease, including the types of drugs used in treatments. The shift around ventilators has potentially far-reaching implications as countries and companies ramp up production of the devices.

Many forms of ventilation use masks to help get oxygen into the lungs. Doctors' main concern is around mechanical ventilation, which involves putting tubes into patients' airways to pump air in, a process known as intubation. Patients are heavily sedated, to stop their respiratory muscles from fighting the machine.

Those with severe oxygen shortages, or hypoxia, have generally been intubated and hooked up to a ventilator for up to two to three weeks, with at best a fifty-fifty chance of surviving, according to doctors interviewed by Reuters and recent medical research. The picture is partial and evolving, but it suggests people with COVID-19 who have been intubated have had, at least in the early stages of the pandemic, a higher rate of death than other patients on ventilators who have conditions such as bacterial pneumonia or collapsed lungs.

This is not proof that ventilators have hastened death: The link between intubation and death rates needs further study, doctors say.

In China, 86 percent of 22 COVID-19 patients didn't survive invasive ventilation at an intensive care unit in Wuhan, the city where the pandemic began, according to a study published in The Lancet in February. Normally, the paper said, patients with severe breathing problems have a 50 percent chance of survival. A recent British study found two-thirds of COVID-19 patients put on mechanical ventilators ended up dying anyway, and a New York study found 88 percent of 320 mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients had died.

More recently, none of the eight patients who went on ventilators at the Abu Dhabi hospital had died as of April 9, a doctor there told Reuters. And one ICU doctor at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta said he had had a ""good"" week when almost half the COVID-19 patients were successfully taken off the ventilator, when he had expected more to die.

The experiences can vary dramatically. The average time a COVID-19 patient spent on a ventilator at Scripps Health's five hospitals in California's San Diego County was just over a week, compared with two weeks at the Hadassah Ein Kerem Medical Center in Jerusalem and three at the Universiti Malaya Medical Centre in the Malaysian capital Kuala Lumpur, medics at the hospitals said.

In Germany, as patient Bergmann struggled to breathe, he said he was getting too desperate to care.

""There came a moment when it simply no longer mattered,"" he told Reuters. ""At one point I was so exhausted that I asked my doctor if I was going to get better. I was saying, if I had no children or partner then it would be easier just to be left in peace.""

Instead of putting Bergmann on a mechanical ventilator, the clinic gave him morphine and kept him on the oxygen mask. He's since tested free of the infection, but not fully recovered. The head of the clinic, Thomas Voshaar, a German pulmonologist, has argued strongly against early intubation of COVID-19 patients. Doctors including Voshaar worry about the risk that ventilators will damage patients' lungs.

The doctors interviewed by Reuters agreed that mechanical ventilators are crucial life-saving devices, especially in severe cases when patients suddenly deteriorate. This happens to some when their immune systems go into overdrive in what is known as a ""cytokine storm"" of inflammation that can cause dangerously high blood pressure, lung damage and eventual organ failure.

The new coronavirus and COVID-19, the disease the virus causes, have been compared to the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918-19, which killed 50 million people worldwide. Now as then, the disease is novel, severe and spreading rapidly, pushing the limits of the public health and medical knowledge required to tackle it.

When coronavirus cases started surging in Louisiana, doctors at the state's largest hospital system, Ochsner Health, saw an influx of people with signs of acute respiratory distress syndrome, or ARDS. Patients with ARDS have inflammation in the lungs which can cause them to struggle to breathe and take rapid short breaths.

""Initially we were intubating fairly quickly on these patients as they began to have more respiratory distress,"" said Robert Hart, the hospital system's chief medical officer. ""Over time what we learned is trying not to do that.""

Instead, Hart's hospital tried other forms of ventilation using masks or thin nasal tubes, as Voshaar did with his German patient. ""We seem to be seeing better results,"" Hart said.

In Wuhan, where the novel coronavirus emerged, doctors at Tongji Hospital at the Huazhong University of Science and Technology said they initially turned quickly to intubation. Li Shusheng, head of the hospital's intensive care department, said a number of patients did not improve after ventilator treatment.

""The disease,"" he explained, ""had changed their lungs beyond our imagination."" His colleague Xu Shuyun, a doctor of respiratory medicine, said the hospital adapted by cutting back on intubation.

Luciano Gattinoni, a guest professor at the Department of Anaesthesiology, Emergency and Intensive Care Medicine, University of Göttingen in Germany, and a renowned expert in ventilators, was one of the first to raise questions about how they should be used to treat COVID-19.

""I realised as soon as I saw the first CT scan ... that this had nothing to do with what we had seen and done for the past 40 years,"" he told Reuters.

In a paper published by the American Thoracic Society on March 30, Gattinoni and other Italian doctors wrote that COVID-19 does not lead to ""typical"" respiratory problems. Patients' lungs were working better than they would expect for ARDS, they wrote - they were more elastic. So, he said, mechanical ventilation should be given ""with a lower pressure than the one we are used to.""

Ventilating some COVID-19 sufferers as if they were standard patients with ARDS is not appropriate, he told Reuters. ""It's like using a Ferrari to go to the shop next door, you press on the accelerator and you smash the window.""

The Italians were swiftly followed by Cameron Kyle-Sidell, a New York physician who put out a talk on YouTube saying that by preparing to put patients on ventilators, hospitals in America were treating ""the wrong disease."" Ventilation, he feared, would lead to ""a tremendous amount of harm to a great number of people in a very short time."" This remains his view, he told Reuters this week.

When Spain's outbreak erupted in mid-March, many patients went straight onto ventilators because lung X-rays and other test results ""scared us,"" said Delia Torres, a physician at the Hospital General Universitario de Alicante. They now focus more on breathing and a patient's overall condition than just X-rays and tests. And they intubate less. ""If the patient can get better without it, then there's no need,"" she said.

In Germany, lung specialist Voshaar was also concerned. A mechanical ventilator itself can damage the lungs, he says. This means patients stay in intensive care longer, blocking specialist beds and creating a vicious circle in which ever more ventilators are needed.

Of the 36 acute COVID-19 patients on his ward in mid-April, Voshaar said, one had been intubated - a man with a serious neuro-muscular disorder - and he was the only patient to die. Another 31 had recovered.

Some doctors cautioned that the impression that the rush to ventilate is harmful may be partly due to the sheer numbers of patients in today's pandemic.

People working in intensive care units know that the mortality rate of ARDS patients who are intubated is around 40 percent, said Thierry Fumeaux, head of an ICU in Nyon, Switzerland, and president of the Swiss Intensive Care Medicine Society. That is high, but may be acceptable in normal times, when there are three or four patients in a unit and one of them doesn't make it.

""When you have 20 patients or more, this becomes very evident,"" said Fumeaux. ""So you have this feeling - and I've heard this a lot - that ventilation kills the patient."" That's not the case, he said. ""No, it's not the ventilation that kills the patient, it's the lung disease.""

Mario Riccio, head of anaesthesiology and resuscitation at the Oglio Po hospital near Cremona in Lombardy, Italy's worst-hit region, says the machines are the only treatment to save a COVID-19 patient in serious condition. ""The fact that people who were placed under mechanical ventilation in some cases die does not undermine this statement.""

Originally nicknamed ""iron lungs"" when introduced in the 1920s and 1930s, mechanical ventilators are sometimes also called respirators. They use pressure to blow air - or a mixture of gases such as oxygen and air - into the lungs.

They can be set to exhale it, too, effectively taking over a patient's entire breathing process when their lungs fail. The aim is to give the body enough time to fight off an infection to be able to breathe independently and recover.

Some patients need them because they're losing the strength to breathe, said Yoram Weiss, director of Hadassah Ein Kerem Medical Center in Jerusalem. ""It is very important to ventilate them before they collapse."" At his hospital, 24 of 223 people with COVID-19 had been put on ventilators by April 13. Of those, four had died and three had come off the machines.

Simpler forms of ventilation - face masks for example - are easier to administer. But respirator masks can release micro-droplets known as aerosols which may spread infection. Some doctors said they avoided the masks, at least at first, because of that risk.

While mechanical ventilators do not produce aerosols, they carry other risks. Intubation requires patients to be heavily sedated so their respiratory muscles fully surrender. The recovery can be lengthy, with a risk of permanent lung damage.

Now that the initial wave of COVID-19 cases has peaked in many countries, doctors have time to examine other ways of managing the disease and are fine-tuning their approach.

Voshaar, the German lung specialist, said some doctors were approaching COVID-19 lung problems as they would other forms of pneumonia. In a healthy patient, oxygen saturation - a measure of how much oxygen the haemoglobin in the blood contains - is around 96 percent of the maximum amount the blood can hold. When doctors check patients and see lower levels, indicating hypoxia, Voshaar said, they can overreact and race to intubate.

""We lung doctors see this all the time,"" Voshaar told Reuters. ""We see 80 percent and still do nothing and let them breathe spontaneously. The patient doesn't feel great, but he can eat and drink and sit on the side of his bed.""

He and other doctors think other tests can help before intubation. Voshaar looks at a combination of measures including how fast the patient is breathing and their heart rate. His team are also guided by lung scans.

Several doctors in New York said they too had started to consider how to treat patients, known as ""happy hypoxics,"" who can talk and laugh with no signs of mental cloudiness even though their oxygen might be critically low.

Rather than rushing to intubate, doctors say they now look for other ways to boost the patients' oxygen. One method, known as ""proning,"" is telling or helping patients to roll over and lie on their fronts, said Scott Weingart, head of emergency critical care at Stony Brook University Medical Center on Long Island.

""If patients are left in one position in bed, they tend to desaturate, they lose the oxygen in their blood,"" Weingart said. Lying on the front shifts any fluid in the lungs to the front and frees up the back of the lungs to expand better. ""The position changes have radically impressive effects on the patient's oxygen saturations.""

Weingart does recommend intubating a communicative patient with low oxygen levels if they start to lose mental clarity, if they experience a cytokine storm or if they start to really struggle to breathe. He feels there are enough ventilators for such patients at his hospital.

But for happy hypoxics, ""I still don't want these patients on ventilators, because I think it's hurting them, not helping them.""

As governments in the United States and elsewhere are scrambling to raise output of ventilators, some doctors worry the fast-built machines may not be up to snuff.

Doctors in Spain wrote to their local government to complain that ventilators it had bought were designed for use in ambulances, not intensive care units, and some were of poor quality. In the UK, the government has cancelled an order for thousands of units of a simple model because more sophisticated devices are needed.

More important, many doctors say, is that the additional machines will need highly trained and experienced operators.

""It's not just about running out of ventilators, it's running out of expertise,"" said David Hill, a pulmonology and critical care physician in Waterbury, Connecticut, who attends at Waterbury Hospital.

Long-term ventilation management is complex, but Hill said some U.S. hospitals were trying to bring non-critical care physicians up to speed fast with webinars or even tip sheets. ""That is a recipe for bad outcomes.""

""We intensivists don't ventilate by protocol,"" said Hill. ""We may choose initial settings,"" he said, ""but we adjust those settings. It's complicated.""

That all changed on April 16 when Tajik investigators knocked on their door to ask about his 24-year-old son, Sunatulloh Karimov. That's when the family learned that Sunatulloh was one of five Tajiks arrested in Germany for allegedly plotting Islamic State (IS) terrorist attacks.

In fact, the news of their arrests -- announced by German prosecutors on April 15 -- also came as a surprise to the authorities in Tajikistan. That's because the suspects had never been listed by the domestic security services as potential terrorists, sources say.

Vali Karimov tells RFE/RL that his son moved to Germany in 2016 and married a 'German' woman there.

The third of Vali Karimov's four children, Sunatuloh was born and raised in the remote rural district of Muminobod near the border with Afghanistan.

His father says Sunatulloh left their village for Tajikistan's capital, Dushanbe, in search of work in 2012 because the family didn't have enough money for him to continue his studies.

Still a teenager, Sunatulloh found a job at a private shop selling automobile parts in Dushanbe. According to his father, Sunatulloh also became interested in learning languages and became 'quite fluent in English and Russian.'

Sunatulloh traveled to Germany four times along with his Dushanbe-based business partner between 2012 and 2016 to restock the shop, his father recalls.

Sunatulloh's last business trip to Germany was in 2016. But he didn't return home. Instead, Sunatulloh told his parents that he'd decided to stay in Germany permanently.

Back in Tajikistan, Sunatulloh's family knew little about his new life in Germany, other than a few scarce details he shared during telephone conversations.

Sunatulloh told his parents that he met his future wife -- an intern at a dental clinic -- when he sought treatment for a toothache. He told them the woman converted to Islam and changed her name to Aisha.

'We call her Aisha. We don't know what her original name was,' Vali Karimov says about the daughter-in-law he has never met.

Shocked by the news of Sunatulloh's arrest, his father says the family contacted Aisha for an explanation about what had happened. He says Aisha told them the arrest was a 'mix-up' and that 'he will be freed' soon. She also told the family not to worry.

He says Aisha told them the couple had been due to move into an apartment under a German social-housing project following the birth of their second child.

Until his arrest, Sunatulloh was believed to be still actively involved in his old business in Dushanbe, sending spare parts from Germany.

RFE/RL obtained contact details for Sunatulloh's business associate, identified by sources as Nurmuhammad M. But he did not respond to phone calls and has not been present at his workplace for several days.

The government in Dushanbe hasn't publicly commented on the arrests. Tajik officials and diplomats say they have yet to receive official notification from Germany about the case.

But Tajik sources told RFE/RL that law enforcement agencies in the Central Asian country began their own investigation after international media reported about the arrests. Those sources said there were still many things that domestic intelligence services do not know about the five suspects arrested in Germany.

German prosecutors have released only the first names and last initials of the suspects -- identifying them as Azizjon B., Farhodshoh K., Muhammadali G., Sunatulloh K, and Ravshan B. and that they ranged in age from 24 to 32.

German authorities also said Ravshan B. was thought to be the ringleader of an IS cell in Germany.

According to the German authorities, all of the suspects arrived in Germany as asylum seekers.

Four of the suspects were arrested at different locations in the western German state of North Rhine Westphalia during police raids that involved some 350 officers early on April 15.

German police said Ravshan B. has been in custody since March 15, 2019.

Sources in Tajikistan told RFE/RL that the alleged ringleader's full name was Ravshan Boqiev. They said he had lived in Dushanbe prior to leaving for Russia several years ago.

According to the German authorities, all of the suspects arrived in Germany as asylum seekers. North Rhine Westphalia Interior Minister Herbet Reul said German police 'have had the suspects in [their] sights for a long time.'

German officials allege that the five men pledged allegiance to IS in January 2019 and had been getting instructions from two high-ranking IS figures in Syria and Afghanistan.

The 30-year-old Boqiev is alleged to have been a contact person between a Germany-based cell and IS. He also allegedly distributed instructions to the others on how to make explosive devices.

German news weekly Der Spiegel has reported that Boqiev came to the attention of the German intelligence services in December 2018.

German officials say the group's initial plan was to return to Tajikistan to stage terrorist attacks there. But authorities charge that the suspects subsequently decided to plot attacks in Germany on U.S. military facilities and on an unnamed individual that the group deemed as being critical of Islam.

The German officials say the suspects had already started collecting firearms, ammunition, and bomb-making materials. They say they also began surveillance of their potential targets.

Authorities said the men collected money in Germany to finance their terrorist plans and to send to IS extremists fighting in Syria. Boqiev also accepted $40,000 to carry out an assassination in Albania, according to German media reports.

Those reports say Boqiev and an accomplice traveled to Albania to carry out the contract killing, but returned to Germany after their plan failed.

Back in southern Tajikistan, Vali Karimov says he doesn't know anything about Boqiev or the other alleged associates of his son in Germany.

RFE/RL has established that a third suspect is Muhammadali Ghulomov from the Rudaki district, about 17 kilometers south of Dushanbe.

RFE/RL correspondents have yet to obtain further information about Ghulomov and his life in Tajikistan. Nothing is yet known about the other two suspects, identified as Azizjon B. and Farhodshoh K.

Germany's Federal Public Prosecutor says the suspects are currently in pretrial detention and that each is being represented by defense lawyers.

The government in Dushanbe says about 2,000 Tajik nationals have traveled to Syria and Iraq in recent years to join IS militants.

Some of them have returned to Tajikistan, taking advantage of an amnesty offered by the government.

Dozens of IS extremists were captured by Iraqi, Syrian, Kurdish, and Turkish forces after the fall of the militant group in Syria and Iraq. The exact number of Tajiks killed in fighting and air strikes is not known.

Some Tajik nationals are thought to have joined an IS affiliate in neighboring Afghanistan, while the IS group has claimed responsibility for the killing of four Western cyclists in Tajikistan in July 2018.

Deadly riots at Tajik prisons in November 2018 and May 2019 have also been claimed by the IS group.

A stock market crash presents the perfect opportunity for you if you want to double your money in a few years. The situation does not look bright at all, with the COVID-19 pandemic raging across the planet and decimating global economies by shutting down all non-essential businesses.

However, if you can play your cards right and find the right stock to invest in, there is a chance for you to double your money — especially if you invest in a Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA).

Market downturns are always a fantastic opportunity to pick up at a bargain. If you hold your investment for the discounted price in a TFSA, you can keep all the returns once the stock recovers to higher valuations.

Over the past few months, global markets have been suffering the effects of the COVID-19 shutdown. The oil price war that recently ended also took its toll on the Toronto Stock Exchange. However, once all of this passes, and it will eventually, stocks will rise again.

I am going to discuss the strategy you could use to capitalize on the market crash and double your money through Manulife Financial (TSX:MFC)(NYSE:MFC) stock.

Don’t hold on to too much cash as the market recovers

To discuss how you can double your money in the current market crash, I will discuss the crash 12 years ago and the mistake many investors made. As a meltdown becomes apparent, it is a natural reaction for many investors to begin selling the shares they own in any and all stocks.

As investments dip below 5%, 10%, or even 20%, selling the shares makes sense. It helps an investor save a few dollars, as the company’s stock declines further. It leaves investors with cash that they can use to buy stocks at bargain prices. The question is, when do you get back into the market?

This was a problem plaguing investors back in 2008. In the aftermath of the crash 12 years ago, investors had plenty of cash they hoarded from the selloff frenzy. The problem is, most investors were not fast enough to pump that money back into the market. Those who kept sitting on the cash missed out on the opportunity to capitalize on the market recovery.

The perfect example from 2008

Manulife Financial taught investors an ideal lesson of how you can miss an ideal opportunity if you wait too long. MFC is one of the most prominent insurance companies in the world and provides financial services to customers all over the world.

MFC became one of the safest bets for Canadian investors as it rose to prominence. It exhibited extreme growth potential, especially from 2000 to 2007. On November 1, 2007, the share prices for this stock went as high as $44.23 per share. A year later, the stock fell to $26.50, as the carnage of the 2008 market crash ensued. The stock continued to nosedive as it hit $9.55 by March 9, 2009.

Most investors decided to cut ties with the stock. Compounded with the horrific news of the markets bottoming out, and the stock market situation being the worst they had seen at the time, investors became fearful about getting back into the market. By July of 2009, in a matter of a few months since its terrible low, Manulife climbed back up to $26.16 per share.

Manulife Financial is just one of the examples of mistakes investors can make in a market crash when they let their emotions rule their decisions.

At writing, MFC is trading for $17.12 per share. It dipped by more than 50% between January and March 2020. The stock is up by 32% in the past month, and it can expect to recover to its more usual range as the markets recover.

It is paying shareholders a fantastic 6.54% dividend yield. It is a with a five-year dividend-growth streak. The company is also significantly more substantial than it was 12 years ago. Today, it enjoys a more robust financial position with reduced sensitivity to equity market movements. It generates revenues from its existing customer base without relying primarily on new sales.

Between its juicy dividend yield and potential capital gains, I think Manulife is in a decent position to double the money you invest in it and store in your TFSA. While I cannot predict when exactly the market crash will end, there are estimates that it could last for at least a year and a half until a vaccine can be designed for the novel coronavirus."

Deputy chief medical officer Dr Jenny Harries said while there is “probably a very, very small potential beneficial effect” in some enclosed environments, “the evidence is really very, very difficult to tease out”.

Meanwhile Professor Peter Horby, chairman of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (NERVTAG), which is looking into the benefits of face masks, called the data “weak”.

His words were echoed by chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance at Thursday’s Downing Street press conference, who said the evidence on face masks “has always been quite variable, quite weak and difficult to know”.

However, Government scientific advisers have now finalised their advice on the wearing of face masks by the public, Downing Street confirmed.

The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said the Cabinet was told on Thursday that the recommendations of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) had been submitted for ministers to consider.

“They have finalised their advice. Ministers will now be reviewing this to decide on any further action that might be needed,” the spokesman said.

Scientific advisers for the Government had been carrying out a review of the use of face masks, despite the World Health Organisation (WHO) saying that there is no evidence to support their use by the general population.

Dr Harries said “the fact that there is a lot of debate means that the evidence either isn’t clear or is weak”.

“The number one thing is, we must leave our medical masks, if you like, for those people that need them at the front line, because there is clear evidence that that is beneficial.

“For the average member of the public, and it may be for example if you’re walking out in an open space, you’re practising good social distancing measures, you are neither going to be a risk to anybody else or to yourself.

“So it’s not quite so simple as just wearing a mask or not,” she told ITV’s Good Morning Britain.

Asked about places where it is difficult to effectively social distance, such as on tube trains, Dr Harries said: “So taking aside the risk that you might actually be creating a problem, in a sense of trapping the virus and then not disposing of it carefully, there is probably a very, very small potential beneficial effect in some enclosed environments.

“But the evidence is really very, very difficult to tease out.”

Meanwhile, Prof Horby said he does not personally wear a mask when he goes outside.

“The data are difficult and the reason that you’re seeing different policies is because the data are weak,” he told BBC Radio 4’s The World At One programme.

Prof Horby said that if you look at the testing of masks in “field conditions”, where they are given to people in the community, “their effectiveness is much, much lower”.

He added: “There’s also the problem of wearing the mask properly, they’re very difficult to wear properly for a long time, and so for prolonged exposures their effectiveness is really quite low.”

On Wednesday, Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, urged the Government to “fully assess” the impact any new advice could have on health service supplies.

While in the Commons, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: “We’ll follow the advice, we’ll listen to what the Sage advisory group says on masks and then we will implement that.”

He added that if the advice was changed, the Government “can’t promise that we will give everybody free masks”."

664,664,https://www.natlawreview.com/article/cdc-relaxes-self-isolation-guidelines-critical-infrastructure-workers,CDC Relaxes Self-Isolation Guidelines for Critical Infrastructure Workers,Centers for Disease Control & Prevention CDC relaxed previous guidance on critical infrastructure workers working after potentially exposed COVID-19. Interim guidelines allow critical infrastructure w,www.natlawreview.com,"Employers in essential or “critical infrastructure” industries face significant challenges in maintaining business operations while ensuring the health and safety of their employees and their community. Although workers in various industries are now working remotely, many employers (and their employees) that provide essential services do not have that luxury. As a result, businesses engaged in critical infrastructure should implement protocols and policies to limit potential exposure and ensure the health and safety of their employees.

On April 8, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) relaxed its previous guidance on critical infrastructure workers returning to work or continuing to work after being “potentially exposed” to COVID-19. According to the CDC, an employee is “potentially exposed” if they are in a household with, or have been closer than six feet from, an individual who has confirmed or suspected COVID-19, within 48 hours before the individual became symptomatic. The interim guidelines now allow critical infrastructure workers who have had potential exposure to COVID-19 to return to work more quickly or to continue working, provided the workers (i) are and remain asymptomatic; and (ii) that their employer(s) implement certain policies and/or protocols to protect their employees, as well as the community.

Why Has the CDC Revised Its Self-Isolation Guidelines for Particular Job Categories?

The question of what to do when an employee becomes exposed to COVID-19 is becoming more common for essential businesses that continue operations during quarantine and/or shelter-in-place orders. When announcing these guidelines, the CDC’s Director stated: “One of the most important things we can do is keep our critical workforce working,” noting that these guidelines would help stabilize the workforce and avoid a shortage in the critical infrastructure sectors.

To Whom Does the Interim Guidance Apply?

The CDC’s interim guidance pertains to “critical infrastructure workers” in sixteen (16) different sectors of work, previously defined by Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (“CISA”) as the chemical, commercial facilities, communications, critical manufacturing, dams, defense industrial base, emergency services, energy, financial services, food and agriculture, government facilities, healthcare and public health, information technology, nuclear reactors, materials and waste, transportation systems, and water and wastewater systems sectors. These sectors were previously identified because their “systems and assets, whether physical or virtual, [are] so vital to the United States that the incapacity or destruction of such systems and assets would have a debilitating impact on security, national economic security, national public health or safety, or any combination of those matters.” 42 U.S.C. § 5195c(e).

What Is the New CDC Guidance?

Previously, the CDC recommended that any worker having “close contact” with an individual suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19 be sent home for a period of up to fourteen (14) days. As of April 8th, essential or critical infrastructure workers are advised that they can stay and/or return to work, so long as they are and remain asymptomatic, and employers take the following additional precautions:
• Measure the employee’s temperature and assess their symptoms prior to the employee starting work. Employers should ensure that they have proper mechanisms and procedures in place prior to implementing temperature monitoring of employees. Further, the CDC notes that an employee temperature check should ideally take place before the employee enters the facility.
• Increase the frequency with which the employer cleans and disinfects all areas such as offices, bathrooms, shared or common work areas, and shared work surfaces.

In addition, the potentially exposed employee should self-monitor for symptoms of COVID-19 under the supervision of the employer’s occupational health program, and wear a face mask at all times in the workplace for fourteen (14) days following the date of last exposure (or potential exposure). In the event of face mask supply shortages, the employer may approve an employee-supplied cloth face covering. The employee should also practice social distancing, as his/her work duties permit, including maintaining a six-foot distance between the employee and others.

Note that this interim guidance does not change the CDC’s previous guidance as to non-critical infrastructure workers. Non-critical infrastructure workers are advised to leave work and quarantine for a period of 14 days if exposed to COVID-19. For more information on handling a positive diagnosis in a non-essential workplace, see our prior post.

What If an Employee Becomes Sick During the Work Day?

In the event an employee is no longer asymptomatic or becomes sick during the workday, employers should send the affected employee home immediately, and work surfaces should be promptly cleaned and disinfected. Prior to sending the ill employee home, if possible, the employer should compile information regarding any individual(s) the employee may have had close contact (e.g. within six feet) within the prior two days. The employer should also notify those who had close contact with the ill employee while the employee had symptoms and two days prior to the symptoms appearing in order to allow for additional monitoring and/or precautions to be established.

Although this interim guidance has been framed as a mechanism to allow for continuity of operations, employers should continue to be aware of their obligations and responsibilities under applicable federal and state laws, including employers’ obligations under the Families First Coronavirus Response Act’s paid sick leave provisions."

Using the outer grid of the HDFC Bank logo, the Bank has created physical markers on the ground to help people maintain the World Health Organisation (WHO) prescribed social distance while waiting in queue at a shop or in any an establishment.

After a successful pilot run in Kolkata, the Safety Grid campaign has been launched in Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru, Kolkata, Hyderabad, Pune, Chandigarh and Bhubaneswar.

‘The Safety Grid’ will be painted in front of the space leading to various retail outlets such as pharmacies, grocery stores, and ATMs, among others. Each grid will be placed at an optimal WHO prescribed distance of 1 meter from each other.

To begin with, ‘The Safety Grid’ will be implemented at over 4,000 essential services stores across the eight cities. Till date, it has been implemented at over 1,750 essential services stores.

“Social distancing is one of the primary ways in which we can keep this deadly Covid-19 disease at bay. But in reality, one does need to step out to buy essentials. The grids are a physical manifestation of the social distancing that individuals must maintain in any public setting. It’s a simple but extremely powerful idea and a simple solution, albeit a bold one,” Rajdeepak Das, MD (India) and Chief Creative Officer, Leo Burnett South Asia said while speaking about the campaign."

The grant awarded to the Berkeley County Council is available under the Coronavirus Emergency Supplemental Funding program, authorized by the recent stimulus legislation signed by President Donald Trump.

""Communities across the district are in need of assistance. I am happy to announce this funding for Berkeley County, offering funding for expenses such as medical supplies, protective gear, hiring of additional staff and overtime in relation to the county's response the COVID-19 pandemic,"" Powell said in a news release.

""These funds will provide hard-hit communities with critical resources to help mitigate the impact of this crisis and give added protection to the brave professionals charged with keeping citizens safe.""

The law gives jurisdictions considerable latitude in the use of funds for dealing with COVID-19.

Potential uses include hiring personnel, paying overtime, purchasing protective equipment, distributing resources to hard-hit areas and addressing inmates' medical needs.

Agencies that were eligible for fiscal 2019 under state and local Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance grant programs are candidates for the emergency funding.

Local units of government will receive direct awards separately according to their jurisdictions' allocations."

668,668,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/apr/23/va-medical-facilities-struggle-cope-coronavirus/,VA medical facilities struggle to cope with coronavirus,"As she treated patient after patient infected with the coronavirus at a Veterans Affairs medical center in New York City, Heather Espinal saw stark warning signs.",www.washingtontimes.com,"BOSTON (AP) — As she treated patient after patient infected with the coronavirus at a Veterans Affairs medical center in New York City, Heather Espinal saw stark warning signs.

So many nurses had called in sick, she said, that the Bronx facility was woefully understaffed. It lacked specially equipped rooms for infected patients, she said, and didn’t have enough masks, gloves and other protective gear to guard against the spread of the highly contagious disease.

Espinal, 34, says she and her colleagues were told to do the best they could, using a single N95 face mask for an entire shift rather than getting a new one for each patient. In early April, she tested positive for COVID-19.

“I definitely believe it was related to me being at work,” said Espinal, who was out sick for two weeks.

Espinal is one of 1,900 VA health care workers who have become sick with the coronavirus, according to agency documents obtained by The Associated Press. Twenty have died. Another 3,600 of the 300,000-plus VA health care employees are quarantined and unable to work because they have been exposed to the virus, according to VA figures.

As the coronavirus spreads across the U.S., VA health care facilities are struggling with shortages of workers and the equipment necessary to protect employees from contracting the virus, according to VA staff and internal documents obtained by the AP.

“We thought we were doing everything right, even with reusing these N95 respirators. But we still ended up getting sick,” Espinal said.

More than 5,700 veterans treated by the VA have been infected by the coronavirus, and nearly 380 have died.

The Labor Department is now investigating, and several Democrats in Congress plan to send a letter Thursday calling on President Donald Trump to invoke the Defense Production Act to get more supplies for VA health facilities.

The VA, responsible for the health care of 9 million military veterans, denied it was short of supplies and stressed that it follows federal health guidelines when rationing personal protective equipment like masks and gloves.

“VA’s PPE conservation posture is precisely why the department has not encountered any PPE shortages that have negatively impacted patient care or employee safety,” said spokeswoman Christina Mandreucci. She said the VA has moved aggressively in recent weeks to add staff, hiring 3,183 people, including 981 nurses, from March 29 to April 11.

But interviews with nurses and other employees at facilities around the country, internal VA documents, and a March report by the agency’s inspector general tell another story.

The facilities were short of staff and equipment like masks, eye shields, hand sanitizer and gowns. Some workers were forced to reuse masks for days or weeks, according to interviews with VA nurses. In hard-hit states like New York, a crush of coronavirus patients led to a shortage of negative pressure rooms to limit the spread of the virus, several VA nurses told the AP.

The VA inspector general’s staff visited more than 230 facilities in March. It found that nearly a third of the medical centers could improve their processing for screening visitors. More than half of the medical centers reported shortages of supplies and equipment including respirator masks, and 10 reported shortages of staffing mostly for nurses in intensive care units.

“There has been a failure of leadership at VA, and veterans, VA employees and the public are suffering as a result,” said Paul Rieckhoff, founder and former head of the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America and now host of the podcast “Angry Americans.”

Susan Gordon, a senior policy analyst at the nonpartisan Veterans Healthcare Policy Institute, said VA preparations were hampered by inadequate funding and staff, leaving it with nearly 50,000 job openings.

“In VA facilities all over the country, they are doing a really incredible job trying to respond to the crisis in a situation where they have been deliberately crippled by the Trump administration,” Gordon said.

As the nation’s largest health care system, the VA typically enjoyed preferred status in orders for medical supplies from prime vendors.

But as the outbreak escalated in the U.S., surging demand for crucial medical equipment spurred frantic competition for supplies, including from state governments and the National Stockpile. The Federal Emergency Management Agency began buying supplies directly from manufacturers, and VA began submitting its orders to FEMA alongside others.

Not long after, according to people familiar with VA’s weekly briefings to Congress, the supply shortages got worse as medical workers burned through 250,000 masks a day.

On April 7, the VA issued guidelines asking workers to ration masks in response to what the department described as “shortages” and challenges in getting “adequate supplies” to protect VA staff, according to an internal memo. Citing Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, the VA said employees in direct contact with COVID-19 patients should use N95 masks as protection but may need to reuse them. VA staff working with high-risk elderly or vulnerable patients, such as those in nursing homes or spinal cord facilities, would only get one face mask per work week.

After criticism from staff, and a small increase in supplies, the VA on April 16 said those employees working with high-risk elderly or vulnerable veterans could now have one face mask per day.

Individual medical centers have wide discretion if they face shortages, including allowing employees in direct contact with COVID patients to use surgical masks instead of N95 respirators and permitting staff to bring their own.

All other VA staff would be encouraged to bring in handmade masks, even if they work in a building where the disease is present.

A complaint filed by the American Federation of Government Employees alleges that VA workers who came in contact with someone suspected of contracting the virus were told on orders of VA Secretary Robert Wilkie that they still had to report to work — ignoring a 14-day quarantine period. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration is investigating.

The staff and equipment shortages are creating chaos at the VA medical center in Brooklyn, New York, according to Maria Lobifaro, an intensive care nurse.

“Usually the ratio is one nurse to two critical patients. I’m having five critical ICU patients on ventilators,” said Lobifaro, who also is a member of the union National Nurses United, which has organized protests as VA facilities in Brooklyn and Baltimore.

“This has happened four times in the last week and a half. It’s to the point where … my hands are trembling because of what I’m going to walk into,” she continued. “I’ve never seen anything like this.”

A group of Senate Democrats blames Trump for a “broken procurement and distribution system developed by this administration.”

“Those who care for veterans should not be afraid to wake up every morning, go to work and help save veterans’ lives,” says a letter being sent to the White House on Thursday by Sen. Jon Tester of Montana, the top Democrat on the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee. More than a dozen senators joined him, including Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Kamala Harris of California, all former 2020 presidential contenders.

Wilkie defended his agency’s response.

“We have the lowest employee infection rate in the world. It is less than half of 1 percent,” he said Wednesday on MSNBC, citing higher rates in Italy and elsewhere in the U.S.

Irma Westmoreland, a nurse at the Charlie Norwood VA in Augusta, Georgia, said it’s hard for nurses to be tested, so no one really knows how bad the situation is.

“We are told if you have symptoms or feel like you have been exposed and you want to be tested unless you are veteran, you can’t be tested,” Westmoreland said, adding that employees are told go to their own doctors if they want to be tested.

“It’s stressful for the nurses to be in this environment,” she said. “But it’s even more stressful when they don’t have information they need.”"

That’s the case with the Bengals, who have remained steadfast in their desire to make Burrow the No. 1 overall pick of the NFL Draft. Every indication is that decision has already been made, as it’s now just a matter of waiting for Cincinnati to announce it later tonight.

However, that hasn’t stopped the Dolphins from attempting to make a Godfather-type offer to get Burrow, who they view as the next Joe Montana, according to CBS Sports’ Jason La Canfora.

Adding to this, Pro Football Talk reports the Dolphins are actually attempting to acquire the No. 3 overall pick from the Lions to pair with the No. 5 pick in a massive trade package to pry Burrow away from the Bengals.

Getting two top-five picks would be nice, but neither of those prospects would be Joe Burrow, and that’s all the reason Cincinnati needs to not even entertain the offer, especially if you think he has Hall of Fame potential like a Montana-level prospect would.

It’s hard to see Burrow having as good of a career as Montana, but just being mentioned in the same breath is even more reason for Bengals fans to celebrate and enjoy every second of tonight’s draft."

European football's governing body's executive committee met on Thursday to decide on the issue and several others as the game grapples with the implications of the coronavirus pandemic.

According to The Times, the committee has decided that it will decide qualifications on the basis of ""sporting merit,"" as opposed to the UEFA coefficient ranking. However, there has been no update for what happens to Manchester City's spot from the Premier League in such a scenario. City are second on the Premier League table but were slapped with a two-year ban earlier in the year for breach of Financial Fair Play rules.

Earlier it was reported that UEFA was mulling restarting the Champions League in August.

According to a report on Sky Sports Italia, the first of the remaining matches in the Round of 16 will be played on August 7 and 8 after which there will be matches every three days until August 29 when the final is scheduled to be held.

The semi-final will be on August 18-18 and 21-22 before the final in Istanbul.

This would also result in the group stage of the 2020/21 season of the Champions League being postponed to October 20."

bringing the total number of cases in the Republic to 17,607.

An additional 28 patients diagnosed with Covid-19 in Ireland have died today.

Speaking at the press briefing, Dr Tony Holohan, Chief Medical Officer at the Department of Health said the number of confirmed cases today is reflective of an ambitious programme of testing in nursing homes.

The Health Protection Surveillance Centre revealed that as of midnight on Tuesday, Dublin had the highest number of cases at 8,216 followed by Cork with 1,087 cases.

""Modelling data shows us that the reproduction number remains below 1.0 and that we have achieved great progress through the action of staying apart,"" Dr Holohan stated.

""In order to continue protecting ourselves, our vulnerable groups and our healthcare workers, we must continue to practice physical distancing, respiratory etiquette and regular hand washing.

""These basic steps, if done by all, will save many lives,"" he continued.

""Today, the World Health Organisation Regional Director for Europe noted that up to half of those who have died of Covid-19 across Europe were living in residential care settings.

""Ireland continues to closely examine mortality so that we can understand it and do everything in our power to prevent it.

""We are now using our increased testing capacity to focus on staff and residents so that we can learn in real-time about this virus and take actions informed by that evidence.""

Professor Philip Nolan, Chair of NPHET Epidemiological Modelling Advisory Group stated that as a result of the public's cooperation with government and HSE directives, the transmission of the virus is effectively suppressed

""For the population at large, the growth rate is at zero and the transmission of the virus is effectively suppressed.

""Our R number is between 0.5 and 0.8. This success emphasises how vital it is to remain vigilant in our behaviours.

""If the R number moves above one, we are no longer in control of the disease,"" he explained.

So far, there have now been 794 Covid-19 related deaths in Ireland. The median age of deaths in Ireland is 83."

“We want to ensure that all residents, both Malaysians and non-Malaysians, living at these two areas will have enough food until the enhanced MCO is over on May 3.

“I admit that there were some hiccups where there were insufficient supplies or the distribution was not as thorough as it should be, but we have improved on that aspect, ” he said at a press conference after a site visit to the Kuala Lumpur wholesale market in Selayang on Thursday (April 23).

Annuar said that census revealed there are about 17,000 residents, out of which there are 10,000 foreigners staying in 3,200 residential units,

The remaining 7,000 are locals living in 1,500 residential units.

On Monday, Senior Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob announced that the enhanced MCO would begin on April 20 until May 3.

Areas affected included Jalan 6/3A, Jalan 9/3A, Jalan 2/3A of Pusat Bandar Utara, Kuala Lumpur as well as Taman Batu View, Taman Batu Hampar, and Taman Sri Murni Phase 1,2 and 3.

The order, however, would not affect the supply of fresh produce as the wholesale market will not be closed.

The market is supposed to reopen on Friday.

“Both locals and foreigners will be given some basic items like cooking oil, rice, canned food, flour and others.

“Shoplots here are have been allowed to open since Wednesday so that the residents can still top up on supplies.

“However, operators and customers will have to adhere to strict social distancing guidelines and police officers and the army will observe their movement, ” he said."

The statement added that on its busiest day, approximately 300 people were contact tracing, making more than 5,000 calls, after more than 1,400 people had their Covid-19 tests confirmed.

There are nine contact tracing centres throughout the country, four of which were in operation today.

At the largest contact tracing centre at University College Dublin, Professor Mary Codd, Associate Dean of Public Health, told Prime Time that there are 72 phone lines in six rooms, and UCD has capacity to increase its output of contact tracing by more than 50% if required. 

 

 She said that the ideal scenario would be a 48-72 hour turnaround from an initial swabbing of a suspected case of Covid-19, to confirmation of a case, to contact tracing, and identifying clusters and giving advice to people to isolate. 

 

 Dr Tomás Ryan, from the School of Biochemistry and Immunology in Trinity College, told the programme that the key to best ensuring a responsible easing of the current restrictions was to follow the South Korean model of testing, contact tracing, and isolating - all in very quick time."
678,678,https://www.inquisitr.com/6013385/new-york-coronavirus-antibodies/,Study Shows Over 20 Percent Of New Yorkers Have Tested Positive For Coronavirus Antibodies,"The preliminary results of a study commissioned by Gov. Andrew Cuomo on coronavirus antibodies present in New Yorkers have been released, and findings are suggesting that more than one-fifth of city ...",www.inquisitr.com,"The preliminary results of a study commissioned by Gov. Andrew Cuomo on coronavirus antibodies present in New Yorkers have been released, and findings are suggesting that more than one-fifth of city dwellers are either positive with COVID-19 or have battled the virus in the past.

According to a series of tweets issued by CNBC reporter Meg Tirrell, the study claimed that 21.2 percent of people in New York had coronavirus antibodies in their blood.

The high number will likely not come as a shock to health experts, as New York has long been considered the major hotspot of the virus in the U.S. There have been over 142,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the Big Apple alone, with a death toll of close to 11,000.

Antibody findings were also high in the city suburbs. In Long Island, 16.7 percent of those tested were found to have coronavirus antibodies; in Westchester and Rockland counties, the number hovered around 11.7 percent. The rest of the state was substantially lower at 3.5 percent.

The overall average of New York state found that 13.9 percent of the population had traces of coronavirus antibodies in the blood. Though the empire state ostensibly has 257,216 confirmed cases, the new study would suggest that as many as 2.7 million people have been infected.

The study also looked into the racial makeup of those affected by the disease. The highest levels of infection came from participants who answered “multi, none, or other,” at 22.8 percent. However, it was closely trailed by those who identified as Latino or Hispanic, with 22.5 percent testing positive for antibodies. African Americans posted similarly high levels, at 22.3 percent.

Those who identified as Asian had a rate of 11.7 percent, and Caucasians were the lowest group at 9.1 percent.

The study consisted of around 3,000 surveys conducted in 19 counties and 40 localities across the state. Participants were usually approached at grocery stores or big-box retailers. The research described the participants as “people who, by definition, are out of the home and not at work.”

This means that potentially more accurate results will come as the second phase of coronavirus testing commences.

The study appears to confirm the warnings of many health experts, including the city’s health commissioner, Dr. Oxiris Barbot.

According to Fox 5, Barbot claimed that the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the city were “just the tip of the iceberg.”

“It wouldn’t surprise me if, at this point in time, we have probably close to 1 million New Yorkers who have been exposed to COVID-19,” she added.

Additional information will also likely be obtained come the advent of at-home testing kits. As was previously reported by The Inquisitr, the kits will be available in most states in the “coming weeks.”"

The 33-year-old actor was charged with two counts of possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute, plus two counts of possession of a weapon by a felon. According to records, Mitchell had two pounds of marijuana and MDMA in his possession, and was carrying an AK-47 firearm and a Glock 9mm pistol with extended magazines.

“At the moment, Jason is currently preparing himself for several projects, in light of this very unfortunate and untimely misunderstanding. Fortunately it will all will be resolved shortly, in a positive manner, as he has faced many challenges that he has faced in the past,” his agent, Dr. Glenn Toby, said in a statement.

Mitchell was released from Harrison County Jail on Wednesday.

The actor, best known for his role as rapper Eazy-E in the 2015 NWA biopic “Straight Outta Compton,” made headlines last year following allegations of harassment from “The Chi’s” showrunner Ayanna Floyd Davis and co-star Tiffany Boone. He was later dropped from the Showtime drama and multiple other projects, including the Netflix film “Desperados” after it was reported he was involved in an off-set incident during the production of the movie.

In an interview after Mitchell was fired from “The Chi,” series creator Lena Waithe said she first became aware of the allegation against the actor at the end of the show’s first season. She also confirmed that there was sexual harassment training on set and said she called Mitchell directly to address him, but his behavior continued.

After his breakout role in “Straight Outta Compton,” Mitchell went on to appear in films including “Mudbound,” “Kong: Skull Island,” “The Mustang” and “Detroit.”"
680,680,https://www.darientimes.com/business/article/CT-jobless-totals-surge-into-Great-Depression-15221413.php<UDIV>https://www.wiltonbulletin.com/business/article/CT-jobless-totals-surge-into-Great-Depression-15221413.php,CT jobless totals surge into Great Depression territory,,www.darientimes.com,"Connecticut reached a level of joblessness this week matching the national unemployment rate during the heart of the Great Depression.

The state on Thursday surpassed 400,000 new unemployment insurance applications filed since March 10, when Gov Ned Lamont ordered businesses to shutter in an effort to stem the spread of the novel coronavirus.

That number represents roughly 23 percent of the state’s working population, most having lost jobs during the six weeks since Lamont’s declaration of a public health emergency.

Add in the roughly 42,000 people already receiving jobless benefits or out of work but not seeking assistance, and the ratio rises to one in every four people available to work in Connecticut lacking a job.

U.S. unemployment reached a record 24.9 percent in 1933. On Thursday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported an additional 4.4 million people nationally applying for unemployment last week, pushing the pandemic totals to 26 million claimants.

“Right now, the level of (worker) displacement is something that government hasn’t been prepared for — this is an exogenous shock of proportions we haven’t seen,” said Donald Klepper-Smith, an economist with DataCore Partners in New Haven. “Connecticut is in the crosshairs of the worst recession dating back to the start of World War II.”

From the outset of Lamont’s emergency order in Connecticut, claims have overwhelmed the state Department of Labor, saddled with insufficient staff to handle the volume — and a decades-old mainframe and software platform for processing claims. On Thursday, the state’s labor commissioner said the DOL has adjusted systems to help reduce the backlog of pending claims, but available staff to process them remains stuck at about 80 people, due to it taking at least three months to sufficiently train reinforcements.

“It’s a financial crisis when anyone is laid off, (and) we at DOL are doing everything in our power to manage the tsunami of claims that have been submitted,” Commissioner Kurt Westby said on a Thursday conference call. “We know patience is running out for some.”

Westby indicated the state has processed $230 million in payments since the start of the crisis. The state’s unemployment trust fund is down to about $400 million, he said, but officials in Hartford expect to bolster it with ongoing payroll taxes collected from employers as well as federal aid.

DOL will not have systems in place until early next week to release $600 weekly supplemental payments authorized under the federal Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act. The CARES Act extended assistance to solo business owners and independent contractors who ordinarily would not qualify, but who will be able to file for unemployment compensation beginning April 30.

From a projected six-week delay in processing claims earlier this month, DOL has gotten the lag down to less than four weeks with the anticipation of shaving another week off the window by the end of April.

But the DOL’s deputy commissioner on Thursday said the claims system still creates unexpected logjams if any steps are missed, citing a “code 108” message that some people have received indicating their claim is on hold.

“In one particular situation that I just did this morning, they had their claim application in (and) they got one week (payment) — then they missed filing the next week, and then the following week they tried to do it and go back,” said Dante Bartolomeo, deputy commissioner of DOL. “It put a hold on their account because the week that they missed meant that they reported zero wages. That triggered a stop in our system. ... The system is actually doing what it’s supposed to when it’s seeing a variance.”

But variances can be introduced with the best intentions — for instance, by individuals checking a box that they are unavailable to work in any given week due to caring for a family member who has come down with coronavirus, which Bartolomeo indicated would put up a red flag requiring a DOL staff member to intervene.

“When we’re seeing those, we’re taking batches of these and ... we have a group in one of our offices that are going into those ‘stops’ (and) looking at them,” Bartolomeo said. “At this point in time, we’re not doing as much calling — we’re resetting them, but it is a one-by-one, manual process.”

DOL has processed 327,000 new claims to date — completing 138,000 in the past week alone — leaving 76,000 outstanding as of Thursday. Westby said an unknown number of remaining claims include duplicates filed in error or impatience, with additional claims continuing to arrive.

DOL spokesperson Nancy Steffens said the department is averaging between 5,000 and 9,000 new claims daily, down from a peak of 15,000 a day in the early days of the pandemic.

DOL has been steering people to an online tutorial at www.ctdol.state.ct.us and www.fileuict.com, with a list of frequently asked questions that is being updated nearly daily. Complaints have been ongoing, however, from those who are not getting resolution and who are having difficulties otherwise getting assistance from DOL via phone or email.

“We are responding to approximately 3,000 emails a day and this week expanded the work day for responding to emails to 12 hours a day,” Steffens stated in an email response to a query. “We are also responding to hundreds of calls daily.”"

A of February, when Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced he would open his country’s borders with Greece to migrants and refugees, Salih, an Afghan living in Istanbul, heeded the call, as did thousands of others. But the Greek side of the border was closed. For ten days, Salih waited and slept rough near the main crossing. Eventually, Turkish police drove him and a few others to a river separating the two countries and ordered the group to cross by boat, threatening them with batons. Greek guards then captured him, took his cash and phone, and sent him back. By the time he returned to Istanbul, where he had earned a living fixing windows since escaping the Taliban, the covid-19 pandemic was in full swing. His job was gone. The company he worked for had closed. Salih, who lives with his wife and two children, can no longer pay rent and faces eviction. “We ran out of money,” he says. “We have nothing left.”

Across Turkey, the pandemic is taking an increasingly heavy toll in lives and in jobs. For the second time in as many years, a recession beckons, this one more severe than the last. The expects the economy to contract by 5% this year. An avalanche of lay-offs has already started to swell. It will hit the millions of migrants and refugees living in Turkey hardest, and it will hit them first.

Mr Erdogan would like to prevent mass loss of life without risking economic collapse. But he may end up with both. His government has suspended all international flights, closed schools, cancelled communal prayers at mosques, and ordered people above 65 and below 20 to remain at home. But it has also kept the economy running, albeit in low gear.

This piecemeal approach is starting to backfire. On April 10th the government imposed a weekend curfew in the country’s biggest cities with only two hours’ notice. Within minutes, hundreds of thousands of people stormed supermarkets and bakeries to stock up on food. Turkey’s infection rate was already rising rapidly. In the first three weeks of April, confirmed cases spiked from under 16,000 to over 90,000. The botched curfew will have made things even worse.

The economy, which rebounded late last year, is reeling again. Exports in March were down by 18% compared with the same period in 2019. Tourism, which generated $35bn last year, is bracing for a lost summer. The central bank, having burned through billions of dollars to prop up the Turkish lira, has nearly run out of foreign reserves. The currency is sliding, placing yet more pressure on companies with foreign-currency debt.

No one is more vulnerable than the migrants and refugees who have made Turkey their home over the past decade. Some 70% of the 3.7m Syrians in Turkey are poor or nearly poor. The vast majority work informally, which makes them ineligible for compensation or unemployment benefits. A recent survey revealed that only 3% of employed Syrians had official work permits. “They were hired for being the cheapest labour and they will be the most disposable ones,” says Omar Kadkoy, a researcher at , a think-tank in Ankara.

Scores have already been sacked. Maysarah, an Egyptian who worked at a stall selling dried fruit in Istanbul’s once bustling Grand Bazaar, says his bosses fired him and dozens of other migrants when the bazaar closed in March. Waseem, a Syrian who drives a food-delivery truck, says he managed to hold on to his job. Four of his five Syrian flatmates have lost theirs. Because refugees generally work off the books, there is no telling how many have been laid off since the start of the crisis. The jobless rate is 14%, but that figure dates back to January. Economists fear it will easily pass 20% by the summer.

The government has tried to help the economy weather the storm with a 100bn- lira ($15bn) stimulus package, which allows affected businesses to defer loan and tax payments and offers support to households in need. Parliament has also passed a law banning companies from sacking workers over the coming three months and offering those forced to take unpaid leave roughly $6 a day. None of this applies to migrants or refugees.

Turkey may soon turn to a familiar source for additional funding. In 2015 the offered Turkey $6bn if it agreed to look after the refugees and prevent them from crossing to Greece. Mr Erdogan deserves no reward for playing with their hopes to put pressure on European governments. But the migrants and refugees knocking on Europe’s doors do deserve better. Against the approaching storm, many of them are defenceless. Once again, the will probably be obliged to clench its teeth, loosen its purse-strings and entrust Turkey’s leader with lots more money. ■

685,685,https://www.motor1.com/news/414273/bloodhound-lsr-top-gear-walkaround/,Top Gear Shows The Science Behind A 628-MPH ‘Car’,Test pilot Andy Green explains what it takes to control the Bloodhound LSR at such high speed and acceleration rates.,www.motor1.com,"The last time we heard from the Bloodhound Land Speed Record team, the Brits were looking for a new financial injection of about £8 million ($10.22 million at current exchange rates) to keep the project running. Apparently, it’s very important for the team not to miss the cool weather window in July and August in the Hakskeenpan salt desert, South Africa, before temperatures go too high and make running the rocket impossible this year.

The jet-powered LSR machine already did an impressive test run, hitting 628 miles per hour (1,011 kilometers per hour) in approximately 50 seconds. Interestingly, the car wasn’t supposed to go that fast but the vehicle’s turbofan engine responds differently to throttle input at higher speeds. When test pilot Andy Green throttled back, there was approximately a half-second delay where power stayed full.

In a new video by , Green explains what it takes to control the LSR at such high speed and acceleration rates. 628 mph in 50 seconds equals about 20 mph per second at the start of the run and - as Green compares it - it’s the same feeling as getting from 0 to 60 mph (0-96 kph) in about three seconds. But that’s a constant G your body has to absorb.

Looking at the video and seeing how the LSR’s nose is slightly deviating from the straight mark line is seriously scary. Green explains all the little moves he does while controlling the car and his cold-blooded reactions are absolutely impressive. I mean - at about 350 mph (536 kph), “the car is starting to run nice and slowly,” “250 mph, we are now at slow speed.” Yeah, right.

From the uncovered screws which connect the body’s panels to the 159 air pressure sensors - Andy Green explains all the little details that make the Bloodhound LSR so special and actually capable of hitting 1,000 mph (1,609 kph). Check out the video at the top of this page."

688,688,https://www.prokerala.com/news/articles/a1033168.html,"Govt did not want to give one big package, many medium size packages likely to be announced: Sanyal","The government did not want to give one big package unlike other countries and many medium size packages are likely to be announced and response will be sooner than anticipated, according to Sanjeev Sanyal, Principal Economic Adviser, Finance ...",www.prokerala.com,"New Delhi, April 23 : The government did not want to give one big package unlike other countries and many medium size packages are likely to be announced and response will be sooner than anticipated, according to Sanjeev Sanyal, Principal Economic Adviser, Finance Minister.

In a call hosted by Elara Capital on Wednesday, Sanyal said the government wants to direct more resources in the rebuilding phase. A spokesperson from Elara Capital refrained from commenting on the call.

In the fiscal response, he indicated that more measures will come. Sanyal said the government is preparing for the long haul and keeping the powder dry. ""Most other countries have responded in a knee jerk fashion and have nearly exhausted their ammunition. Govt in India knows that we are in this for a long haul and hence more pronounced responses will be needed over next few months as the full scale of economic impact becomes visible,"" he added.

He indicated the packages will come ""in reasonable time"". ""Within reasonable limits the government shall make allowances for the current fiscal situation. We got to be sure that the government doesn't spend all our ammunition at one go"", he said.

He emphasized that India has taken a different approach to fight the covid pandemic and is mindful of the repercussions if the epidemic is not controlled.

""India is prioritising containment and hence has been proactive in announcing a stringent and an early lockdown. The Government believes that if the epidemic is not controlled then the repercussions will be very difficult to manage. Thanks to this approach, infection rate in India is much lower given our population,"" he added.

The focus is on a step by step by step approach in lifting the lockdown. Government is taking a calibrated approach, Sanyal said. ""From 3rd May onwards, depending on the feedback, except for a few hotspots a significant part of the economy can be opened up. The evaluation will be done on the basis of the incoming data,"" he indicated.

On the government's policy approach, Sanyal said, ""The government has taken a view that we need to hedge for the worst and accordingly take a gradual approach in responding to economic shock. As an immediate measure the government has made sure that the poorest and the most vulnerable get fed. Apart from monetary and fiscal response, structural reforms that improve the efficiency of businesses will be undertaken,"" he added.

On the best approach to lift the lockdown, Sanyal said that India has so far gone for a sectoral approach for gradual opening of the economy.

""Eventually India needs to take the geographical approach. There is no logic in keeping Sikkim shut when there are no cases there. In the near term, inter-state large scale movement of people will have to be controlled. There will have to be control over travel out of the country. But goods travel can be opened up completely"", he added, flagging a geographical approach.

He said the government is preparing for the long haul. ""Government's view is that the crisis will last longer than what most people assume. So the government is preparing for a long haul. There could be months before we get out of this. So steady and step by step approach is the key"", he said.

Cheap capital is the key, Sanyal added that the government believes that it is important that the cost of capital is kept low. Hence there is more room for interest rates to fall and for transmission to improve. Both corporate and government are borrowing at high rates. India has more space on the monetary side than fiscal, the Principal Economic Adviser added.

He believes the post covid world will be a reset. ""The post covid world will see a reset at different levels: social, economic, geopolitical, supply chain, technological among others. The Government of India realises this and hence wants to focus on measures that ensure that we see economic gains in the long run"", he said, elaborating on a complete reset and how to capitalize on it.

India will attract the supply chain shift. ""India wants to take all measures needed to attract supply chains that are likely to get reset in the post covid -economic order. Very important that Indian businesses remain in a risk-taking mode else India will not be able to take advantage of this global reset of order"", he added.

The government will do everything in its capacity to ensure that businesses remain healthy especially in the MSME sector. The lower leverage of Indian businesses is proving to be a blessing in the current phase, he said.

India will play an important role in the post Covid world, Sanyal said and the government is already providing a huge leadership at multiple levels especially at the G-20. ""Our response to health situations has been appreciated widely"", he added.

He emphasized the need to ""Think Big. Think Bold"". Hinting at coming reforms, he said. ""We need to boldly market our country to the entire world. We need to be able to re-think our tax laws, labour laws, legal system."" For instance, it takes over 40 days to deliver a cloth from Delhi to New York and 18 days of the 40 are taken in India itself. This is a glaring pain point that needs to be addressed. Industry needs to think big & demand big; not get tied up with miniscule matters, he added.

Just as India undertook measures to restrict Chinese FDI through automatic route, the government will be vigilant to dumping issues and respond in a timely manner, Sanyal said.

Unionized Detroit automakers and non-union German and Asian automakers have been preparing to restart U.S. vehicle making operations by early May. Companies have shifted reopening dates amid uncertainty about government stay-at-home orders.

Gamble's statement appeared to derail plans by the Detroit Three to start bringing UAW workers back to vehicle manufacturing jobs on May 4. The longer the automakers cannot produce profitable U.S.-made trucks and sport utility vehicles, the longer they burn cash.

The UAW leader's statement was also aimed at Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, who has come under pressure from conservative groups and President Donald Trump to ease coronavirus stay-at-home restrictions.

""At this point in time, the UAW does not believe the scientific data is conclusive that it is safe to have our members back in the workplace. We have not done enough testing to really understand the threat our members face,"" Gamble said.

""We strongly suggest to our companies in all sectors that an early May date is too soon and too risky to our members, their families and their communities.""

Gamble said the union was ""happy with the auto companies? response and cooperation on working through the health and safety protocols we will need in the workplace when it is appropriate to restart.""

Earlier Thursday, GM began notifying front line managers to come back to work next week to get trained on new safety protocols designed to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus as workers return to plants.

""What we are doing is making sure the people who are going to lead in our plant facilities, and lead period, understand the protocols well enough,"" GM's global head of manufacturing, Gerald Johnson, told Reuters in an interview Thursday at a former transmission factory in Warren, Michigan, where workers are now making face masks for donation to hospitals and GM's own use.

Johnson spoke before Gamble issued his statement. The GM executive took questions while wearing a surgical mask and protective glasses - gear workers will be required to wear on the job as they return, he said.

Many GM managers must now learn how to deal with ""additive and new"" safety procedures, Johnson said.

GM will not rush to ramp up production, he said. ""We think it's smart to be limited and phased in our restart,"" he added, saying it ""has to be metered by demand.""

Johnson did not say when GM plans to restart operations. Suppliers said before Thursday they expected the automaker to begin some production work May 4.

Separately, Toyota Motor Corp said on Thursday it expects to gradually resume North American production starting May 4 and will impose significant new safety procedures after it halted operations in March because of the coronavirus outbreak.

The largest Japanese automaker said it expected production will be slow next month. The company added it was not yet clear when the industry will be allowed to resume operations in Mexico. Toyota will add temperature checks for all plant employees, personal protective gear, use ""touchless"" entrances and exits and will even bar non-emergency use of elevators.

""There is no going back to normal for the foreseeable future,"" said Toyota Motor North America chief administrative officer Chris Reynolds. He said he expected production to ramp up later in May ""to meet consumer demand,"" however.

Ford Motor Co is considering asking some workers to return next week to prepare for restarting production, a person familiar with the matter said. But Ford said it has not decided on a date for resuming production.

Fiat Chrysler Automobiles previously said it hoped to resume North American production on May 4. But the company said in a statement Thursday ""we will only restart operations with safe, secure and sanitized workplaces to protect all of our employees.""

Other automakers have outlined plans to restart U.S. plants over the next two to three weeks. Honda Motor Co said on Thursday it was extending a shutdown of its North American auto plants by one week through May 8."

The detainee has been admitted at the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine in Muntinlupa City since Friday, the BuCor said in a statement.

The bureau said it was able to trace 40 contacts of the infected prisoner, all of whom are inmates. Those exposed were brought to an isolation facility, “where they will be monitored more effectively while awaiting to be tested for COVID-19.”

Both the Quezon City Jail and the Correctional Institution for Women have previously reported COVID-19 outbreaks within their wards.

Department of Justice (DOJ) Undersecretary Markk Perete said that the agency is already coordinating with the Department of Public Works and Highways to build a bigger quarantine area at NBP just in case there is a need for it.

Perete added that the Department of Health has already committed an initial 10,000 test kits for persons deprived of liberty. The first batch of testing will be conducted at NBP and CIW, he said.

Moreover, DOJ assured residents nearby NBP and the Muntinlupa City government that all precautions and protocols were complied with in the transportation of COVID-19 inmates from CIW to the quarantine facility inside the national penitentiary.

The city’s local government recently protested against the transfer of inmates citing that officials were not informed about it.

Perete said that BuCor officials tried to inform the relevant local official but he cannot be reached.

A petition for the early release of prisoners deemed highly vulnerable to the disease is pending before the Supreme Court, as human rights groups deem detention cells as ""ticking time bombs"" for infections."

These two vegetables are so easily cultivated and ready to harvest way ahead of normal cropping time that I`m surprised more gardeners don`t take up the option. No special facilities are required for either of them.

Once upon a time, many years ago, I grew potatoes near the window in a cold garage and occasionally in a spare room that we couldn't afford to heat. The leaves can even take a degree of frost overnight and survive but will succumb when it`s prolonged.

Rhubarb thrives in such conditions. Indeed, gardeners of yore believed in digging up roots with crowns and leaving them on the surface to be frosted before replanting elsewhere. The forcing of new shoots in this garden is encouraged by lightly filling a large pot with straw and inverting it over a rhubarb patch.

No garden? No worries! You can use any large container to grow a few potatoes or stems of rhubarb. An empty compost bag that`s dark on the inside is ideal. Half-fill it with garden soil or growing medium of your choice and plant into that. Water both as necessary and top-up the potatoes as the foliage develops.

Sometimes gardening`s all fun, then something crops up to spoil it. We cut the first asparagus spears last week, very tasty and harvesting continues until early June. Also enjoyed some leaf lettuce growing outdoors. Then I noticed a patch of ground elder emerging in a mixed border and dealt with it immediately, digging out every single piece of root with the garden fork. Oddly

There`s a sense of dismay that our annual horticultural shows have been cancelled and opportunities to visit gardens open to the public put on hold for the foreseeable future. Each year we eagerly anticipate meeting up with acquaintances at the Chelsea, Howick, Warkworth and Glendale shows, but that`s all on hold for the moment. They will return.

Dibleys nursery specialises in house plants and showcases them at Chelsea Flower Show. Their streptocarpus display regularly wins a gold medal and we manage to arrive home with a few new cultivars. This year, undeterred by Chelsea`s cancellation, they`re hosting The Virtual Flower Show UK on Facebook from April 25 – 26 with dozens of the country`s specialist growers and nurseries participating.

`You never miss the water until the well runs dry` is very appropriate when applied to our local gardening attractions.

The Garden Media Guild is always up to speed in keeping members informed of events, the most recent being an update of virtual tours online. They explain that the National Gardens Scheme has launched an initiative to encourage participating owners to film their gardens for online viewing. These would be accessed via a weekly e-newsletter and social media channels. Royal Botanic Garden, Edinburgh has created a virtual spring tour of its four gardens, and you can view Hidcote Garden in the Cotswolds or let Sarah Raven give you a tour of her Perch Hill setup. My favourite thing at present is to think of a garden, local, national or world-wide, check it out online and see what`s happening there at present. Give it a try. The world`s your oyster!

Ironically, this year`s “National Gardening Week” begins next Monday (27th April) and runs until May 3rd. In the April edition of RHS magazine “The Garden” they inform us that in light of the need for self-isolation and social distancing, they`ve changed the theme to `keep gardening.` As recent research has shown, the activity is indeed good for our physical and mental health."

CDP began life as CD Projekt’s distribution company but went independent back in 2014. The two were meant to partner again this year for the distribution of Cyberpunk 2077 in Poland but unfortunately, CDP has filed for bankruptcy and will no longer be distributing the game.

CDP was founded back in 1994 as part of the CD Projekt Group, back when CD Projekt was focusing on selling legitimate, localised copies of games in Poland at a time when piracy was often the only way to play many popular games. CDP was bought out in 2014 and went independent.

CDP was signed on to distribute physical copies of Cyberpunk 2077 in Poland but as reported by Puls Biznesu (via PCGamer), CDP has now filed bankruptcy and has been appointed a temporary supervisor.

CDP had seemingly ran into serious financial trouble when Cyberpunk 2077 was delayed from April to September 2020, at which point the distribution deal fell through and CD Projekt Red had to go with a different company.

KitGuru Says: CDP was an important part of CD Projekt’s history, although it is not as relevant to the company today, which is now one of the most celebrated development studios in the games industry. Still, it is always a shame to see a games company go under."

And it's only right that he does it by giving us a laugh and putting a smile on our faces.

The much-loved Bolton comic will join the star-studded Big Night In affair which broadcasts on BBC One from 7pm on Thursday.

For the first time, Comic Relief and Children In Need are joining forces for a special night of TV where viewers will have the opportunity to donate and help support vulnerable people of all ages and backgrounds across the UK who will be significantly impacted by the coronavirus crisis.

To play his part, Peter vowed to recreate his smash hit music video for Tony Christie's (Is This The Way To) Amarillo from 2005 and asked for key workers to help make the video possible.

And the comedian says he received thousands of clips of people marching to the song.

He tweeted: ""I wanted to say a huge heartfelt thanks to everybody who’s took the time to film themselves marching to Amarillo.

""Lots of very emotional clips from nurses and care workers and key workers and shoe repairers.

""Thank you all xxx""

But who was in the original music video Peter created 15 years ago?

The 2005 music video featured some of the most famous faces on British television, including Michael Parkinson and Ronnie Corbett, raising money for Comic Relief.

Peter's Phoenix Nights co-star Paddy McGuinness also joined him as well as Queen guitarist Brian May, Mr Blobby and many more.

Also involved were Shaun Ryder, Bez, Sally Lindsay and Anne Kirkbride.

The song went on to become the most popular Comic Relief single of all time, selling more than 1.28 million copies after it was released and shooting to number one in the UK charts.

And you have probably heard it many more times since at a party, karaoke session or two.

The original version, recorded by singer Tony Christie in 1971 was a big hit in Europe - reaching number one in Germany and Spain - and charting at 18 in the UK.

The song is written by Neil Sedaka and Howard Greenfield.

The Big Night In is airing live on Thursday at 7pm on BBC One."

Mike DeWine is expected to announce Thursday during his daily COVID-19 pandemic press briefing his plans to begin re-opening the state's economy on May 1.

The daily meeting with the media begins at 2 p.m.

On Wednesday, DeWine announced an order directing healthcare providers in hospitals and outpatient surgery centers to reassess procedures and surgeries that were postponed when the outbreak began.

On March 17, state health director Dr. Amy Acton issued an order postponing elective surgeries to conserve critical personal protective equipment and to open bed space needed to care for COVID-19 patients.

""Because of Ohio's hard work to flatten the curve and because of our health care system’s efforts to come together to meet community needs as a team, we have prevented the massive spike of cases that we feared,"" DeWine said.

""We must now begin the gradual, multi-phased process of reopening, and my first concern is the patients who have had procedures and surgeries delayed,"" the governor said.

The new order directs healthcare professionals to review any postponed procedures or surgeries with their patients.

Doctors and patients should consider the current health situations and make a joint decision about whether or not to proceed. New or other chronic conditions that may have a significant impact on a patient’s quality of life should also be evaluated.

The order also requires patients be informed of the risk of contracting COVID-19 and the impact during the post-operative recovery process.

""Resuming elective surgeries and procedures will take clinical judgment, and we will rely on our healthcare providers to make responsible decisions as we move forward,"" DeWine said.

""Patients must have the information necessary to make informed decisions and must pay greater attention to the effectiveness of non-surgical options,"" the governor said.

Also on Wednesday, the Ohio Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services (MHAS) announced the launch of a new mental health COVID CareLine for Ohioans.

Trained staff will be available to provide emotional assistance to anyone struggling with mental health concerns due to the ongoing stress of the pandemic.

The number to call is 1-800-720-9616. All calls will be confidential.

As of Wednesday afternoon, there were 14,117 confirmed and probable cases of COVID-19 in Ohio and 610 confirmed and probable COVID-19 deaths.

A total of 2,882 people have been hospitalized, including 880 admissions to intensive care units. In-depth data can be accessed by visiting coronavirus.ohio.gov.

Kitco's aggregated sources include some of the top newswires in the world including the Association Press, Canadian Press, Japanese Economic Newswire, and United Press International.",www.kitco.com,"* Volume is highest import level since Dec 2013 (Adds graphic, background on bauxite)

BEIJING, April 23 (Reuters) - China’s aluminium imports more than tripled in March from a year earlier, customs data released on Thursday showed, hitting their highest in more than six years, while incoming shipments of raw material bauxite fell.

Imports of unwrought aluminium and aluminium products came in at 121,025 tonnes last month, compared with 35,420 tonnes in March 2019, the General Administration of Customs said. The intake volume last month was the highest since China imported 125,180 tonnes in December 2013.

China is by far the world’s biggest producer and exporter of aluminium, used in everything from cars to cans, and it rarely imports large volumes of the metal. It exported almost 520,000 tonnes of aluminium overseas in March, data released in mid April showed, down 5% from a year earlier.

It was not immediately clear what caused the jump in imports. One trader said that with overseas demand weak because of pandemic-related disruptions, holders of the metal were seeking to find a home for their aluminium in top consumer China, where demand is starting to recover.

Also, China’s scrap supply of aluminium has been tight since the Lunar New Year holiday in late January as the coronavirus curbs stalled local collection activity, increasing the call on primary aluminium.

First-quarter aluminium imports stood at 302,580 tonnes, 2-1/2 times the incoming shipments of the same period last year.

The customs data did not break down the origins of the imported aluminium but detailed data is scheduled to be released on Saturday.

China’s imports of bauxite, the main ore source of aluminium and which has to be first refined into alumina, were down 10.1% from a year earlier in March, the customs data showed.

It gave a figure of 90,000 tonnes for March arrivals, although year-ago levels were around 9 million tonnes, according to the online customs database. It was not immediately clear why there was such a discrepancy.

China’s General Administration of Customs said last month in its final trade data bulletin it would stop including alumina imports. Alumina exports in March were up 88.2% year-on-year at 10,000 tonnes."

33-year-old Lauren showed off her peachy bum and tiny waist in her skintight leggings and crop top, wearing her brunette locks scraped back into a high pony tail.

The bottoms of her Oh Polly! set featured ruched detail to emphasise the star's honed physique.

Lauren previously slammed suggestions she's had work done on her rear and told sceptical fans: ""I had lipo and sculpting three years ago and that was it. My bum goes up and down with my weight.""

As the nationwide lockdown continues, Lauren said she'd be using her spare time to focus on her health and fitness.

She has been granted more freedom now that her beauty salon Lauren's Way has been closed until further notice.

The single star also quipped to her followers that it was lucky she wasn't isolating with a boyfriend or she'd be 'pregnant within a week.'

But as the health crisis continues, the reality star has been keeping busy by updating fans on her antics across social media.

However, she did come under fire when she was pictured sporting a black face mask as she headed to her Essex salon before the lockdown was imposed in March and shared several selfies wearing similar covers.

Trolls accused her of using the mask as a fashion accessory and slammed her for 'cashing in' on the pandemic.

Lauren immediately told the haters to 'bore off.'

“Have a long hard look at the post and comments and what’s been replied .. trust me I’ll just post more !!!!! It’s a f***ing mask! Which I also was wearing for Aesthetic’s before you lot was!!!!! The world has gone mental!” she wrote in response to another follower."

The letter in question calls on incarcerated persons testing positive for COVID-19 to inform their next of kin to assist in taking civil action (i.e. litigation) against the Department of Correctional Services (DCS).

The letter also speaks to parole decisions being made by the National Council for Correctional Services (NCCS). The letter is framed in unacceptably disparaging terms.

Sonke unreservedly denies authoring the letter, providing permission for the use of our logo, or authorising the circulation of this letter.

We do not condone the content contained in the letter and Sonke would also like to state that we do not know the identity of the author “Adv. Mantombi S. Ntombela”.

While Sonke remains concerned about the health of South Africa’s incarcerated persons, we acknowledge that there are appropriate processes for addressing this - in a way that supports DCS staff and protects the safety of detainees.

We consider letters such as the fake one being circulated, as well as instigatory calls made by organisations such as South African Prisoners Organisation for Human Rights - whose calls for prison strikes at a time like this have already resulted in the serious injury of two inmates at Baviaanspoort Prison - to be reckless and counter-intuitive.

We call on whoever is behind this fake letter to desist from such a practice which is likely to expose inmates into more vulnerability at this critical time.

Sonke will also be communicating the same message to the DCS, and will continue to offer our support during these trying times. Please do not hesitate to contact us for any further information."

A moment when our work is most critical as we continue to serve our customers. Fortunately, several of our customers in North America are in operation and committed to run their factories to support essential national products such as PPE (personal protective equipment). While MES is classified as an ‘essential’ business and remains opens, our global suppliers are faced with unique challenges. Most recently, it was announced that all Indian manufacturers are to close to prevent the rapid spread of COVID-19.

While we are committed to run our operations to meet customer demand, we partner with several Indian manufacturers that now appear to be closed. Unfortunately, this situation could begin to backlog customer orders and a shortage of inventory. However, with the outstanding work by our senior leadership team in India, they received permits and approval by the Indian government to run the production and move the shipments to the port to support our customers. The MES Indian team worked tirelessly with various state government officials and received permission to run the production with a limited workforce, as well as in-land logistics, and to ship the containers to fulfill customer orders. From April 1st and onwards, our shipments are getting moved from supplier location to various port and sailed to the USA.

Receiving approval from the Indian government to run the product through our essential suppliers is a significant accomplishment for MES. While Indian factories are running with a limited workforce, they can produce customers products and avoid a complete shutdown. MES will continue to work closely with customers and provide around-the-clock communications as we work through this pandemic together."

The federal government also created a task force Thursday to oversee blood-test surveys to see how widely the virus has spread in Canada and provide reliable estimates of immunity and vulnerabilities among Canadians.

The new cash builds on $275 million in research funding the Liberals announced in March at the outset of the pandemic.

Most of the new money is aimed at funding vaccine development and clinical trials, including $600 million over two years through a federal innovation fund.

Smaller amounts will support scientific efforts to prevent the rapid spread of COVID-19 and a project led by Genome Canada to track the virus, its different strains and how it makes people ill in different ways.

""A vaccine, obviously, arriving soon would be the best solution,"" Trudeau told a news briefing outside his Ottawa residence.

But he said it may be a long while before a vaccine emerges, and there are discussions about treatments for COVID-19 that might also be effective.

""I mean, we've been waiting for and looking for and searching for a vaccine for AIDS for decades now and it still hasn't come. But there are treatments that mean quality of life for people with HIV have been massively improved,"" Trudeau said.

""There are different ways of moving through. We will take the best ways we possibly can as we move forward.""

The new COVID-19 immunity task force will operate under the direction of a group that includes Theresa Tam, the country's chief medical officer, and Mona Nemer, the chief federal science adviser.

""They'll be looking at key questions like how many people beyond those we've already tested have had COVID-19, whether you're immune once you've had it and, if so, how long that lasts,"" Trudeau said.

The government expects at least one million Canadians will be tested over two years as part of the study.

The current standard testing checks for the presence of the virus now, but immunity testing identifies antibodies that reveal who has been exposed to the virus previously, Nemer told a briefing Thursday. Together, the two will provide a better picture of the overall number of people who have been infected.

Data will help with everything from rollouts of a potential vaccine to determining which public health measures are most effective.

""The better we understand this virus, its spread and its impact on different people, the better we can fight it and eventually defeat it,"" Trudeau said.

About 20,000 Canadians are being tested daily to see if they have COVID-19, almost double the number earlier this month. But testing must accelerate even further before Canadians can begin resuming their usual activities, the prime minister said.

The various initiatives outlined Thursday are about empowering scientists and researchers and giving them tools they need, said Innovation, Science and Industry Minister Navdeep Bains.

""Science is a fundamental component to beating COVID-19 and in order for us to move ahead we need to search for and develop therapeutics and vaccines and we need to have the capacity to manufacture them in Canada as well,"" he said in an interview.

""This made-in-Canada solution and this mobilization effort is very much focused on the health crisis, but also going to benefit Canada in the medium and long-term as well."""

This has raised concerns that people are not getting enough vitamin D – which the body usually produces by itself when skin is directly exposed to sunlight.

But despite the wall-to-wall sunshine that has fallen on many parts of the country this week, not everyone is fortunate enough to have a garden that they can use to enjoy it. And there may be many others who cannot leave the house long enough for daily exercise due to home and family commitments or health issues. What’s more, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has specifically said that sunbathing in public areas is against the government’s guidance on social distancing. To get around the problem, the NHS has advised people to consider taking 10 micrograms of vitamin D supplements a day to keep bones and muscles healthy.

It usually only advises people to do so during the winter months when there is generally less sunlight. The new advice – available on the NHS vitamin D page – adds: “You can buy vitamin D supplements at most pharmacies and supermarkets. Do not buy more than you need.” It also addresses reports about a link between vitamin D and coronavirus, noting: “There have been some news reports about vitamin D reducing the risk of coronavirus. However, there is no evidence that this is the case.” This refers to reports in papers earlier this week that researchers at the University of Granada in Spain are planning to investigate whether vitamin D could be used to help treat Covid-19.

The plans involve a 10-week trial involving 200 coronavirus patients, it is understood. Vitamin D helps to regulate calcium and phosphate levels in the body, which are needed to keep bones, teeth and muscles healthy. If someone does not get enough of it, it can lead to bone deformities such as rickets in children, and osteomalacia in adults, according to the NHS. People can usually get all the vitamin D they need from sunlight during the spring and summer months from around late March/early April to the end of September.

But in the autumn and winter months, between October and early March, there is not enough sunlight for people to produce enough vitamin D themselves. However, sunlight is not the only source of the vitamin. It is also present in a small number of foods, including oily fish, red meat and liver, egg yolks and foods that are fortified such as some breakfast cereals and fat spreads. But the NHS says it is “difficult” for people to get enough vitamin D from food alone."

Maintaining order during a pandemic has its challenges.

Although law enforcement officers are continuing to go to work each day, they are faced with an evolving landscape, changing rules for society and an ever present need to balance their own safety with the safety of the community.

Officials have reported drops in crimes like driving under the influence, but there’s been a spike in some parts of the county in domestic violence, speeding or commercial burglaries as more Americans stay home and many businesses have—at least temporarily—shuttered.

“For our specific agency, the COVID crisis has had a huge impact on how we’ve had to change operations, how we interact with ourselves internally and also how we interact with the public,” Lt. Dan Peak, public information officer for the Chula Vista Police Department in California told Oxygen.com.

As COVID-19 continues to spread throughout the country, an increasing number of law enforcement officers and jail staff are also being exposed and infected—creating concerns about manpower and staffing shortages.

“If you go and there’s an officer that’s positive, everyone he came in contact with at roll call or various places that entire shift could be basically exposed and so under an ideal situation you’d send a whole shift home,” Daron Hall, a Nashville sheriff and president of the National Sheriff’s Association, told Oxygen.com. “Well, law enforcement can’t really survive doing that.”

Law enforcement officers continue to perform many of the same duties they’ve always delivered, but in some cases how that's done has had to evolve to adhere to safety recommendations, social distancing constraints and the current needs within the community.

In Dallas, detectives in the department’s Crimes Against Persons Division, which investigates homicides, robberies and assaults, are now spread out throughout the city and are working from nine libraries rather than a central location to conduct interviews and interrogations as a way to comply with social distancing guidelines, Sgt. Warren C. Mitchell told Oxygen.com.

Mitchell said the change “has not hindered” the department’s ability to conduct thorough investigations and make arrests but has added an element of safety for the community and department’s detectives.

“Officers are practicing social distancing in every way possible when responding to 911 calls,” he said. “Officers are still conducting traffic stops. However, officers are not requiring violators to sign the citation. Instead, officers are documenting COVID-19 in the signature block and making a note of the stop on their body cams.”

Many departments across the country have also adopted a cite and release approach to lower-level non-violent crimes, citing those suspects for misdemeanors and releasing them rather than booking them into jail.

The goal of the strategy is to reduce the number of people being housed inside the country’s jails—where the spread of COVID-19 is significant concern.

“Officers are encouraged to use discretion when it comes to making arrests or citing for low level non-violent misdemeanor offenses,” Mitchell said.

In Chula Vista, Peak said the state of California provided guidance on which offenses, including homicides, domestic-violence related issues and DUIs, should still be considered bookable offenses in the state.

When officers are in public, Peak said they are wearing masks and that they try to maintain the six-foot social distancing rule.

“The officers have extra masks on them and they’ll hand it to a citizen and ask them to put it on if they are not wearing one,” he said.

In New York City, Police Commissioner Dermot Shea said in a briefing last week that the department has Tyvek suits available for detectives and police who have to transport people with known cases of COVID.

Officers who have to transport sex assault victims or others to the hospital for reasons other than COVID-19 have been given special packs with booties and another type of protective suit to try to keep them safe.

“If you are going into a hospital as part of your functions, you shouldn’t be going in there blind,” Shea said.

But even with the protective gear, law enforcement officers may still be at risk.

“You know even if they are wearing a mask … all bets are off when you get in a brawl and that happens for the police every day, in every city,” Chris Berg, a retired detective and co-author of the book “The Night Police” told Oxygen.com. “I think in the long run, it’s going to really impact law enforcement because there are going to be times where they are going to be exposed and there’s absolutely nothing they can do about it.”

Peak said while officers learn in the police academy how to interact with a dangerous subject or how to verbally de-escalate a situation, they haven’t been taught how to handle a combat situation or challenging interaction in a “hot zone for the deadly virus that could potentially kill you.”

“It’s a game changer and something that, you know, we come in on minimal training on,” he said. “Overall, it’s a health issue.”

According to Hall, one of the most significant issues impacting sheriff's offices around the country’s sheriff’s offices are staffing shortages, both on the street and in the jails.

“To me, that’s the most common conversation you hear about is how are we going to manage the jails when you have exposure cases and staff sent home and what do you do about patrolling the streets when you’ve got people who, obviously we don’t want them to come to work if they are sick, but we need people here,” he said.

In Nashville, Hall said that means law enforcement officers are directed not to come to work if they feel sick or have a fever but are still allowed to report for duty if they’ve just been exposed by a partner or family member.

“Originally people were saying 'Well stay home for 14 days and make sure you don’t bring it to work.' Well, we don’t have the fortune anymore. So, what you’re doing is saying come to work, if you’re positive we’re gonna send you home. If you’re symptomatic, we’re gonna send you home but we don’t have the latitude that a lot of other professions have,” he said.

The New York City Police Department has also had to contend with significant shortages.

At its peak, Shea said a total of 7,155 people in uniform were out sick, representing about 20 percent of the department.

Last week, during his briefing, he said the number of those in uniform out sick had dropped to 16.7 percent.

“The good news is it's going down every single day,” he said. “The not great news is it’s a slow and steady process, so it’s going to take time.”

A total of 4,190 in the department have tested positive for the virus.

Shea said the department had been able to manage the shortage because of the drop in crime overall and by shifting the duties of some within the department.

Peak said Chula Vista Police Department has not had an officer test positive for COVID-19 yet, but the department has taken a proactive approach to minimize close contact between officers. For instance, all employees inside the building are instructed to where masks unless they are behind a closed office door.

Briefings are also being held in a large gathering area where officers are at least six-feet apart.

“We’re asking officers to check their temperature. We have thermometers throughout the building, so they are constantly checking their temperatures to make sure they are not having a fever,” he said.

Peak said the department also switched from having three daily shifts to two longer shifts to minimize transitions and contact between officers. The department opted to switch back to their regular schedule on Friday but will continue to assess it on a weekly basis.

One of the biggest staffing challenges for many counties is in the jails, where outbreaks can spread among inmates and staffers due to the close proximity of those housed inside.

“In my opinion, this is the first thing we’ve had that really the more dangerous part of law enforcement is once you get the person to jail because clearly we don’t know how sick they are, you can’t you know, test them immediately and get a result immediately so you’re living with these people for three or four days. You cannot practice social distancing in jail facilities,” Hall said. “It is a very, very difficult place to be.”

As more people are staying at home, authorities are also seeing a shift in the types of frequently reported crimes.

In Nashville, driving under the influence (DUI) arrests are down 57%, Hall said. But other crimes, like those related to domestic violence, are on the rise across the country.

Peak said his department saw an 11 percent increase in domestic violence-related incidents, according to figures from earlier this month.

Evita Caldwell, public information officer for the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department ,told Oxygen.com they had also seen a slight increase in domestic violence. In February, there were 1,300 domestic disturbance calls, up from 1,197 the year before. The department also saw an increase in March calls, from 1,422 in 2019 to 1,439 in 2020.

The Kansas City Police Department reported a 26% increase in 911 calls for domestic violence in the city compared to data from last year, according to The Kansas City Star.

“It is unsettling,” Capt. Tim Hernandez, who supervises the department’s special victims’ unit told the outlet. “We understand what is going on and that it’s going to be harder for victims to contact and call the police. But we still want those in a harmful or dangerous situation to get a hold of us.”

Hall believes the reason for the increase is because Americans are stuck in their homes without an ability to “take a breather, or a break from one another and everything else that goes on in life” and said many families are also struggling with stress and financial concerns.

“What worries me is if our country doesn’t start to open up and give those outlets, it’s going to be very hard to contain"" the potential for domestic violence moving forward, he said.

Domestic violence isn’t the only form of crime on the rise.

Shea said in New York City they’ve seen a “dramatic drop” in radio calls to police and recorded crime overall, but have seen an “uptick” in some parts of the city in terms of shootings and homicides. The city has also seen a “significant uptick” in commercial burglaries, he said in last week’s briefing.

There also may be less traffic on American roadways, but a new report from the Governors Highway Safety Association (GHSA) revealed a “severe spike” in speeding incidents, according to ABC News.

“Unfortunately, speeding hurts everybody because now we’ve got to pull you over, stop, you know, expose you and myself all over something that really is pretty simple for the individual to control,” Hall said.

In a video message on social media, Escambia County Sheriff David Morgan said his investigators in Florida had seen a “tremendous uptick” in online stalking of children now that children are home and “spending hours and hours on the computer” with their friends.

“One of our investigators is working a case right now on a gentleman that attempted to have a sexual relationship with an 11-year-old,” Morgan said. “So, these people are in our communities, unfortunately, and they are preying upon our children, so it’s incumbent upon all of us, not just in law enforcement but certainly the citizens of Escambia County, especially you parents to please, please monitor your children.”

The COVID-19 pandemic and social distancing guidelines have also impacted the way authorities are able to do investigative work.

Peak said investigations typically rely heavily on interviews conducted in close contact with witnesses, victims and suspects.

“It’s changed now to where those interactions can still take place, but they have to be with both parties wearing a mask and, you know, they are also trying to keep their distance at the same time.”

Investigators also often to interview people in their homes—which could now be putting officers at greater risk.

“The other challenge is going and interviewing witnesses and talking to people in houses in which you don’t know what the medical status of that individual is or the home, and clearly having the PPEs (personal protective equipment) and the availability of that when you are knocking on doors … where six months ago we never would have worried about it,” Hall said.

Hall said it will be important for authorities to have ready access to the protective equipment they need in the months ahead, but doesn’t see the additional obstacles as blockers to conducting thorough investigations.

“I don’t see it changing the outcome,” he said. “It will put in some barriers such as time we gotta get dressed and go in and do things to be prepared.”

Berg, who is retired as a detective but continues to work for a California county to do background work and internal affairs investigations, said those types of tasks have been shut down for the most part.

“On the internal affairs side, that is very, very interview- (and) interrogation-heavy and what it’s really done is put the clamps on it,” he said. “Instead of being able to process a case maybe in two weeks, I can’t even tell you what it’s going to look like because there’s about a third as many people in the office doing the investigations and they are taking way longer because we can’t deal with them like we want to and in a way that’s appropriate because it’s just not safe to do so.”

One aspect helping law enforcement officers is that the court systems have slowed down, giving investigators more time to gather evidence and prepare for prosecution, Hall said.

“If you’re the victim of a case, that’s the most important case in the whole system to you and so you deserve to make sure that that doesn’t slip through the cracks, or get ignored, or watered down or anything else and so the only thing I would say is it may delay it a little bit because we’ve got court shut down and everything else,” Hall said. “It does not mean individuals are going to get off with a lesser sanction or anything else. It’s just awaiting justice.”

As the country continues to adjust to its new normal in the months ahead, Hall said one of biggest challenges for law enforcement officers will just be to keep up with the changing rules and restrictions governing each city.

“It’s a challenging time and each day the target moves a little bit because they are trying to keep up with the experts and the scientists and the data,” he said."

At least 434 North Carolinians were hospitalized with COVID-19 Wednesday, up from 427 the day before, according to the N.C. Department of Health and Human Services.

Mecklenburg County has the highest numbers in the state, with 1,331 reported cases and 35 deaths.

Wake County has 622 cases and 10 deaths and Durham County has 469 cases and seven deaths.

N.C. Gov. Roy Cooper is expected to make an announcement at 3 p.m. Thursday about when restrictions will be lifted.

The state’s stay-at-home order is set to expire April 29, and K-12 public schools are closed until at least May 15.

Starting Thursday, some visitors are allowed back to parts of North Carolina’s Outer Banks.

People who own property in Currituck County but don’t live there can arrive starting at 9 a.m. Thursday, as long as they have permits. But visitors won’t be allowed until May 15.

Non-resident property owners will also be allowed back in Dare County, home to most of the Outer Banks, in phases starting May 4, but it’s unclear when other visitors will be permitted.

Both counties previously closed to visitors in an effort to slow the spread of the coronavirus.

Three people at Universal Healthcare Lillington, a nursing home in Harnett County, have tested positive for the coronavirus, county health officials said Wednesday.

There are 39 nursing homes and 14 residential care facilities in North Carolina with ongoing outbreaks, the state health department says.

More than 1,260 coronavirus cases and 109 deaths have been reported among nursing homes and residential care facilities.

Six Durham County Sheriff’s Office employees who work at the county jail have tested positive for the coronavirus, officials said Wednesday.

Officials didn’t say if any of the workers came into contact with inmates, but no inmates have tested positive.

The infected workers are isolated at their homes.

The news came the same day state officials reported an inmate at Pender Correctional Institution, a state prison, died after being infected with COVID-19.

There have been more than 650 cases and and five deaths at correctional facilities in North Carolina, according to the N.C. Department of Health and Human Services.

Drones will soon be used to deliver supplies in the Raleigh and Charlotte areas during the coronavirus pandemic, North Carolina transportation officials said Wednesday.

Debenhams job losses to be raised in Dáil by Cork TD

THE loss of approximately 700 jobs in Cork will be discussed in the Dáil today.

Solidarity TD Mick Barry will today raise the issue of the crisis in the retail sector and the Debenhams closure with the Taoiseach.

The Cork North Central TD will voice his support for a moratorium on company liquidations at least until such time as the lockdown is lifted.

It is understood that he will ask the Taoiseach to voice his support for the proposal too.

The Debenhams case is before the High Court this day next Thursday. If a liquidator is appointed the workers will be set to receive only two week’s redundancy per year of service and the company will end up paying no compensation to staff., according to Mr Barry.

Ahead of today’s Dail sitting, Mr Barry said this morning: “Retail Ireland are telling us that 110,000 jobs are on the line in the sector. Already we have seen the closures of Debenhams, Oasis, Warehouse and Laura Ashley. The Debenhams case is a test case and the way that workers are treated here will set a benchmark. I believe that the State should intervene to save 2000 jobs but that at a bare minimum the State should ensure that Debenhams are not allowed to abscond in the middle of a lockdown without paying a penny to their workers.”

The Solidarity TD also said he would raise with the Taoiseach the use of Garda emergency powers to disperse a Debenhams workers’ protest involving social distancing outside the Henry St, Dublin, store on Tuesday."

Dementia affects almost 50 million people worldwide, which is predicted to increase to 131.5 million people by 2050. Every three seconds someone in the world develops dementia.

The study of 63 people living with mild to moderate dementia, and their care partners, found that telehealth services using videoconferences can save travel time - particularly in rural and remote areas - and equip families with strategies to promote independence in the person with dementia.

Giving care partners strategies to cope with, and delay, functional decline in people living with dementia is a priority, given that about 70% of people with dementia live in their own home with support from family members and friends for assistance,"" says lead researcher Flinders University Associate Professor Kate Laver, an ARC Discovery Early Career Research Fellow and occupational therapist.

""Giving families evidence-based information and skills can promote independence and improve quality of life and wellbeing for people with dementia,"" she says.

Telehealth promises to provide a more affordable alternative for older people living at home, including those with chronic health conditions.

Researchers conclude that the use of telehealth technologies to deliver non-pharmacologic interventions for people with dementia and their care partners may reduce the costs of delivering the intervention, increase accessibility, and facilitate research translation.

On Wednesday, Scott took her pet rabbit to Chippewa Animal Hospital in south St. Louis to get neutered. While she was there, she learned that some stunning news concerning her 10-year-old cat, Nobbie.

""Yeah, it's kind of alarming knowing that my cat could get it,"" Scott said.

""My cat is everything to me and if anything were to happen to her, I don't know what I would do,"" Scott said.

As of Wednesday, two house cats in New York and one Belgium tested positive for the deadly virus and apparently caught it from their owners.

""Cats can get the disease from people so if you are sick, have someone else take care of your cat. It is transmitted the same way humans can transmit it to each other and that is by sneezing and coughing,"" Goss said.

Right now, the Chippewa Animal Hospital is only offering its clients curbside drop-offs and pickups. Pet owners drive up and hand their furry friends to a technician, who wears a mask, gloves and a medical gown, all in the name of safety.

""As for kissing your pet, I say kissing on the top of the head is probably alright. Love your pet, but kissing around the mouth is really not a good idea ever,"" Goss said.

It's a new way of pet care that's also pushing more pet owners to mask up.

""Yes, I am really going to wear my mask when I leave home, especially now that I know that I can give it my cat. If she catches it, I'm sure she won't survive since she's an older cat,"" Scott said.

Meanwhile, what is Goss' best advice to cat owners who want to do everything to protect their cat from the coronavirus?"

Laws approved quickly by legislators

 Meeting outside during the coronavirus pandemic yesterday, legislators rubber-stamped new laws on everything from marijuana to casinos. Although it was a challenge with protesters honking their car horns - even through the opening prayer - and the Speaker of the House had a dizzy spell, the legislators signed several bills advanced by the new Democratic majority.

Delay for Virginia's minimum wage

 Democrats won election in 2019 on a progressive platform that included gun control, minimum wage increases, and more - but they didn't count on a pandemic. The General Assembly narrowly approved delaying a minimum wage increase by four months, citing potential economic hardship to businesses.

What about healthcare expansion?

 One of the major legislative priorities of Virginia Democrats has been healthcare expansion. With the projected shortfall in state revenue and budget issues, there are many Virginians who may not gain healthcare.

Protesters want Virginia to take after Sweden

 Nearly 100 protesters came to the Capital yesterday, demonstrating against COVID-19 restrictions. Using the language of progressive campaigns like Black Lives Matter and the pro-choice movement, along with the racist image from Gov. Northam's 1984 yearbook, they demanded a re-opening of Virginia. Some even asked for a Swedish response to the coronavirus. The Nordic country usually known for a robust social welfare state has become an outlier in its region, for its lack of COVID-19 restrictions and its high death rate compared to Denmark, Norway, and other neighbors.

Courts staying closed

 The Supreme Court of Virginia is extending its judicial emergency order for a third time, to be in effect through May 17. The order has been changed though: If all parties agree, they could meet - in person, on the phone, or by video chat.

Buses might stay free

 Greater Richmond Transit Company CEO Julie Timm proposed to keep the bus system free to make riders, drivers safer. Although the system won't receive the revenue from lost fares, it will also save money by not ticketing - the final price tag is budgeted at $7 million.

In Chesterfield, taxpayers can apply for a payment plan

 Chesterfield has furloughed hundreds of employees due to projected economic impacts from the coronavirus. To help taxpayers, they're now offering payment plans on property taxes.

The organizer of the first Earth Day on what's next for the movement - 50 years after he started it

 Earth Day 2020 was expected to draw one billion people into the streets around the world, to celebrate its 50th anniversary. But founder and organizer Denis Hayes says now it is even more important to take the demonstrations to the ballot box this fall, because the job of saving the planet is not yet accomplished."

However, pro",www.fanbolt.com,"Army Wives fans were sad, upset, and angry on March 27th when beloved character Jeremy Sherwood was killed. However, producer Jeff Melvoin says that death among the wives and their mates has been a long time coming…

Jeremy Sherwood (Richard Bryant) was fatally wounded in the line of duty in Afghanistan on the March 27 episode of Army Wives , and the moment left some viewers as well as cast members “angry,” says executive producer Jeff Melvoin. “I explained, ‘It’s good that you feel that way, because that’s what death means.'”

The decision to kill one of the show’s recurring character’s off was imminent to take the show to the next level after so many seasons. “We felt the time had come to do this — the show has been on for five seasons and never has there been a casualty of a close cast member. In addition to our obligation to entertain, it’s great to bring attention to the sacrifice and commitment of military families.”

However, though Jeremy may have passed, his legacy is “sure to linger on”, says Melvoin. Those left behind that were a part of his life will experience some trouble moving on, especially his parents, Lieutenant Colonel Frank and Denise Sherwood (Terry Serpico and Catherine Bell). Adds Melvoin, “In trying to deal with their son’s death, they have difficulty as a couple, which they overcome, but it’s not an easy task.”

The loss also reopens old wounds for Denise’s closest friend, Claudia Joy (Kim Delaney), who sees visions of her oldest daughter, Amanda (Kim Allen, reprising her role), who died en route to college at the end of Season 1.

Army Wives airs Sundays at 9/8c on Lifetime. Will you tune in for the emotional aftermath?"

The total number of homes passed with Fibre to the Home (FTTH) and Fibre to the Building (FTTB) in 39 European countries reached nearly 172 million homes compared to 160 million in 2018 with nineteen countries now counting more than two million homes passed.

Chances are that it was earlier this year, even though the phrase was coined in 1957, when it meant something akin to “ghosting.” After more than 60 years of stagnation, the phrase instantaneously wove its way into our everyday speech.

As the coronavirus pandemic tightens its grip on seemingly every aspect of daily life, our vocabularies are adapting at warp speed. Once obscure phrases are suddenly commonplace. The virus, nicknamed the rona, has spawned other creative coinages. A quarantini is a cocktail you drink in the isolation of your home. A covidiot is someone who throws a block party when everybody is supposedly sheltered in place. Technical acronyms like PPE (personal protective equipment) have entered everyday speech, as well as slang like WFH (working from home, a.k.a. working from hell). The most meticulous know the distinction between quarantine and isolation. Someday soon, we’ll all start gossiping about isolationships.

Language is trying to keep up with a world in upheaval, a time in which many see the planet as plotting against us, with fresh heat waves, punishing droughts, and wildfires. Every year brings new crises and new words to describe them, such as ecoanxiety, firenado, flight shame, and climate crisis. In an update last April, Merriam-Webster added all sorts of environment-related words to its online dictionary, including microplastic, “a piece of plastic that is five millimeters or smaller in size,” and omnicide, “the destruction of all life or all human life (as by nuclear war).”

Last month, Merriam-Webster announced its fastest update ever, adding COVID-19 — the shortened form of coronavirus disease 2019 — to its online dictionary a mere one month after the World Health Organization minted it. In the slow-moving world of lexicography, that’s a “rapid pace.” Super-spreader, self-quarantine, and patient zero were also included in the special update.

Dictionaries are simply giving the people the resources they want. The Oxford English Dictionary keeps track of the terms being used more frequently than usual, and in March, all 20 of the top keywords had something to do with coronavirus.

“Any new and widespread phenomenon always brings with it the development of new language to describe it,” wrote Fiona McPherson, editorial manager at the OED, in a statement accompanying the dictionary’s update.

Just four months ago, dictionary editors were picking their 2019 “words of the year.” The selections included climate emergency and climate strike (the global protests first started by Greta Thunberg, the 17-year-old Swedish activist), more evidence that the urgency (or anxiety) around climate change was going mainstream. It seemed like everyone was talking about the Green New Deal, whether they loved it or hated it.

This year, the Word of the Year selections will undoubtedly be related to the novel coronavirus. But it’s by no means the only crisis we’ll face in the coming months. Scientists are predicting that 2020 will deliver devastating floods, hellish wildfires, and even more supercharged hurricanes than usual. Hey, at least we’ll have something else to talk about.

“Usual” is already a pretty high bar these days. Heat records are broken so often that they’re hardly considered news. Under a smoky-red sun, the wind has taken ash from burning forests and rained it down on cities. Holing up in your home for months while sewing face masks for your family? That’s definitely not part of the old normal, either."

Fleeing the scene of a crash is an indictable offence.

His arrest comes as the first officer killed in the crash has been identified as 28-year-old Constable Josh Prestney.

Mr Prestney's grandmother, Eliza Anderson, told the Herald Sun he had just begun his new road policing role after graduating from the police academy in 2019.

Speaking to reporters this morning, Victorian Police Commissioner Graham Ashton said the Porsche driver, who had been pulled over by officers before 5pm last night for speeding, had taken photos of the horrific scene before allegedly walking away from the crash site.

“We are pursuing with Facebook that there has been some images placed on Facebook that appear to have been taken by this individual at the scene, before he has left the scene,” Mr Ashton said.

“And some of those photographs were circulating last night online. So, I would ask if anyone is finding photographs online, not to further circulate them. In fact we are talking to Facebook this morning about removing those images from Facebook.”

Mr Ashton said the man’s act was “disgusting” and said the photos were “quite graphic”.

“To leave the scene is a very, very low act in my view,” he said.

“If I wasn’t wearing this uniform as Chief Commissioner I’d be using far more colourful language than this...but I need to be more dignified.”

Two police officers intercepted the man’s 911 Porsche, allegedly travelling at more than 140km/h, on Melbourne’s Eastern Freeway last night.

Police also did an oral fluid test at the scene that returned a positive result for some type of drug, Mr Ashton said.

Those two officers requested back-up and when all four were standing in the emergency lane of the freeway, making the decision to impound the speeding car, the tragic smash occurred.

“A large truck, a refrigerated truck, has then driven into these four police officers”, Mr Ashton said in an emotional press conference last night.

“The truck has also made considerable contact with the Porsche.

“The driver of the Porsche we don't believe was injured but has taken it upon himself to flee the scene on foot.”

The truck’s impact caused carnage at the scene with the highway patrol car being spun into the nature strip in the middle of the Eastern Freeway and the Porsche crushed under the semi-trailer.

The freeway is closed in both directions and remains an active crime scene however police hope to open it later today.

Mr Ashton said detectives had managed to collect footage from the four officers’ body-worn cameras.

Tributes and obituaries for the four officers would come later today, he said, after family had been properly informed of their deaths.

“We will be able to piece together 99 per cent of this...and get a very good picture of exactly what happened,” he said.

A number of good samaritans, including an off-duty paramedic and off-duty doctor, stopped at the scene and tried to render first aid but the four officers were unable to be saved.

Mr Ashton confirmed this morning the truck driver had suffered some sort of medical episode and had “blacked out” after the crash.

“It's not believed he has suffered injury in the accident but has had some sort of medical episode at the scene and has been taken to hospital for medical treatment. We intend him to be there under police guard for some time.”

A warrant was executed on the truck driver’s Cranbourne home early this morning.

“What was found at those premises is still under investigation,” Mr Ashton said.

The death of the four officers is the single deadliest day for Victoria Police in history.

The four who died include a female senior constable, a male senior constable and two male constables, one of whom had only recently joined the force.

Mr Ashton said this morning their deaths had resonated throughout the state’s entire force and reminded Victorians to keep to the 40km/h speed limit when emergency services have their flashing lights on.

“No doubt police out today will be looking well over their shoulders when they make those stops,” he said.

Premier Daniel Andrews issued a message of support to the families of the four officers late last night.

“Tonight, four police officers lost their lives in the line of duty. And tonight, somewhere in our city, four families’ hearts are breaking,” he said.

“Our hearts are breaking with them. But one thing is already clear: Though we may not yet know their names – we will always call them heroes,” he said.

It’s done with pieces from the episodes set against the opening theme song.

Funimation has the show for their spring season lineup with it set to land the same day. It’ll be available to viewers in the US, Canada, UK, and Ireland and is listed as a simulcast at the moment. But that’s no surprise as no dubbing is going on at all right now so any simuldub will be delayed down the line if it gets one.

Toshinori Fukushima is set to direct based on the series composition by Touko Machida. Koichi Kikuta is handling the character designs with Studio A-Cat handling the animation production.

The main Japanese cast includes Ruriko Noguchi as Nozomi Takamura, Rina Hon’izumi as Shiragiku Ōmura, Satomi Amano as Tamaki Yamazaki, Kaori Maeda as Yomi Takeda, Nao Shiraki as Yoshino Kawaguchi, Haruka Yoshimura as Kyōka Fujii, Airi Eino as Risa Fujiwara, Yume Miyamoto as Rei Okada, Rina Kitagawa as Ryō Kawasaki, and Marie Hashimoto as Sumire Fujita.

According to the latest report from data tracker Admango, adspend in the region fell 28% year-on-year for the first quarter of 2020, as the full effects of the COVID-19 pandemic took hold.

Expectedly, this sharp drop was led by the travel and tourism segment, an industry crippled by sweeping lockdowns and bans that stopped people in their tracks. The sector suffered a 91% drop in adpsend. This was only heightened in March as lockdowns intensified and Hong Kong ring-fenced itself from new infections by almost entirely shutting down inbound travel.

In contrast, as people tried to manage their life and leisure in new ways, a few other sectors reported a sharp rise in adspend. In terms of overall adspend, food delivery and catering services marked a 154% YOY increase in spending, while adspend from online store and group buying services accounted for 39% of the total adspend from retail—and increased 26% to become the top spending subcategory.



 In the pharmaceuticals and healthcare category, cold and flu medicine (up 11%), cough and throat (6%), and pharmaceutical products (17%) all enhanced their adspend. Admango has previously reported that the impact from these adspend cuts due to COVID-19 will likely be much deeper than those caused by SARS, back in 2003.

As COVID-19 rapidly morphed into a pandemic, the transition of adspend towards mobile accelerated. According to Admango's estimates, mobile now accounts for over a fifth of adspend in Hong Kong. Mobile remained the sole medium with a double-digit YOY increase in adspend, led by banking and investment services, insurance, and games and hobbies.

As budget cuts begin to bite, several media companies in Hong Kong, led by the South China Morning Post, have made cuts to manage their business during this time. Other embattled media companies including TVB and Apple Daily have also struggled to cope with the slump in spending that has battered businesses for the past few months."
741,741,https://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/ottawa-polices-historic-hiring-year-in-limbo/,Ottawa police's historic hiring year in limbo,,ottawacitizen.com,"What was supposed to be a year of record-breaking hiring for the Ottawa police is now in limbo as a result of the pandemic.

In January, police announced an ambitious hiring plan to grow the force by 100 new officers by year’s end and to have all those officers on the road ready to patrol in 2021. They would help lift morale, ease the workloads of officers stretched too thin after years of hiring freezes and then piecemeal growth of the service, police said.

Chief Peter Sloly said at the time that the fast-tracked hiring of officers was necessary because public safety demanded it. So, too, did a policing strategy that reinvested resources into a neighbourhood-policing model, and prioritized suppression of gun and gang violence and violence against women.

That’s been complicated by COVID-19 and deferring that historic plan is one of the options to start plugging holes of a police budget that is expected to be in the red at least $6 million if the pandemic and the response to curb its spread lasts until December. No final decisions have been made by the service, which continues to evaluate several budget-salvaging options."
742,742,https://www.masslive.com/patriots/2020/04/nfl-draft-2020-hats-ranked-worst-to-best-from-the-browns-disaster-to-fresh-neon-winners.html,"NFL Draft 2020 hats ranked worst to best: From the Browns’ disaster to fresh, neon winners",,www.masslive.com,"It’s time for the 2020 NFL Draft, which means it’s time to see how the league did trying to redesign all 32 logos for new merchandise.

As opposed to previous years, which have head hit-or-miss designs, the 2020 draft hats look pretty good overall -- most of them, at least.

With the draft originally set in Las Vegas (before the coronavirus outbreak changed things), this year’s hats leaned into a simple, clean neon light aesthetic. Well, most of them did at least.

Which team will have the best gear for draft day this year? Here’s a full ranking of the 32 options.

Everything about this hat stinks. They went with the throwback logo, which is to intricate for the neon lighting motif. On top of that, they don’t even get a cool phrase on the side. It just says “Browns.”

Having “Duuuval” on the side is a nice touch. But that logo just looks ridiculous.

You can’t even see the center of the logo.

The Raiders haven’t released their hat design yet. It will reportedly debut during the draft broadcast.

For now, literally not having a design is still better than the previous two options.

The Bears logo featuring the actual animal is already a bit abstract. In this neon light form here, its just sort of a blotchy, orange mush.

Yikes. That white skull in the middle of the read flag is weird-looking.

Did they really need to quite that precise with the details on the Viking’s hair? Less is more with these hats.

The Rams have a long way to go in selling that logo, but it does look decent in this instance. On the other hand, have fun trying to get any fan to say “Time to Shine” with a straight face.

The “Fly Eagles Fly” on the side looks really nice. But the bird logo itself is just a little too muddled.

The colors pop in an interesting way. But the eyes on the horse just look goofy.

You’d think Miami’s color scheme would flourish in this setting. However, they got too intricate in the Dolphin’s look. It’s too muddled.

The white-blue-black color combo is nice. But the thin, flowy lines in the logo just don’t translate well.

The Jets drew the short straw in trying to make this logo seem cool in simple neon lettering.

This could have been really fun if they played around with the neon green a little more. Instead, it just falls flat.

There’s nothing really wrong with this one. But there’s something about the logo on the black background that just doesn’t catch the eye.

This one is completely middle-of-the-road. It doesn’t really lose anything. It doesn’t really gain anything.

This is a very hit-or-miss design. It depends on how much you mind that the white outline of the arrowhead pops over the lettering.

The Ravens logo has always looked nice on black apparel. However, this one’s a little busy.

In the battle of the neon birds, the Cardinal reigns supreme.

The white and red lines in the logo intermingle in a pretty cool way. The slogan on the side is one of the more obscure, though.

The white outline does a good job framing an understated logo, giving the “Flying Elvis” a nice changeup here.

Cincy definitely made the right call sticking with the simple ""B"" symbol here.

The Panthers have also done a good job of playing around with streaks of blue on black. Here, it works with a clean, simple design.

It’s not too different from the usual Saints hat, but it is a nice, clean look.

This is the biggest surprise of the bunch. It takes a logo that usually doesn’t pair well with black and creates a sleek design that pleases the eye with a contrast between long, sharp lines and clear imagery.

The classic ""G"" logo gets a little bit of an aesthetic refresher here. It really benefits from the simple, clean design.

The Colts are almost always blue-and-white. The black hat gives a rare departure from the norm for them on official merchandise. It’s a good look for them.

The neon lights give the hat a really sleek, nearly black-and-white look here. It’s simple and effective.

The big, bold block letters translate well to the simplified neon look. The slogan on the side is also really nice, with the “big blue” popping nicely.

In a sharp departure from the simpler logo designs of the other hats, the Falcons take the “ATL” and give it some nice flair with the wings from the logo. This is the type of hat fans would wear.

The Chargers regularly have one of the best aesthetics in the league and that continues here. The simple white and powder-blue lines pop in an exciting way on the black background. The slogan leaves much to be desired, though.

This hat is simple, looks cool catches your eye and is the type of hat fans would wear on a regular basis. That’s not something you can say about most draft hats."
743,743,https://www.forensicmag.com/563559-Missouri-Ships-Untested-Sexual-Assault-Kits-Amid-COVID-19/,Missouri Ships Untested Sexual Assault Kits Amid COVID-19,Missouri Ships Untested Sexual Assault Kits Amid COVID-19,www.forensicmag.com,"Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt announced today that the sixth batch of untested sexual assault kits identified in the SAFE Kit Initiative inventory were shipped off to the lab. Precautions were taken to ensure that the kits could be safely dropped off while maintaining social distancing requirements.

“One of my top priorities as Missouri Attorney General is to ensure that the untested sexual assault kits continue to be shipped and tested as we move forward with our SAFE Kit Initiative,” said Attorney General Schmitt. “Sheriff Helms and the Camden County Sheriff's Office have gone above and beyond to ensure that these kits are shipped while mitigating risks related to COVID-19, and I appreciate their help on this important initiative.”

“I am proud my department is involved in paving the way for a new response to collecting sexual assault kits from around the area. It has been a great collaboration between many law enforcement agencies and the State of Missouri to make this occur and we appreciate being involved with it,” said Camden County Sheriff Tony Helms.

A total of 96 kits were shipped from neighboring police departments and sheriff's offices, including Centralia Police Department, Osage Beach Police Department, Lake Ozark Police Department, Eldon Police Department, Rolla Police Department, Benton County Sheriff's Office, Phelps County Sheriff’s Office, Morgan County Sheriff, and more.

Corporal Tiffany Blakely from the Camden County Sheriff's Office worked with the Attorney General's Office to implement a delivery system that both protects the health and safety of the individuals participating, as well as the chain of custody. Instead of having all participants gather in the lobby, the Camden County Sheriff's Office provided curbside service for participating individuals, meaning they had the option not to leave their cars. Once all the kits were gathered, the kits were packaged and sent off to the lab.

In addition to Monday's shipping event, shipping events have been held at the police departments in Springfield, Columbia, St. Joseph, Blue Springs, and Joplin.

The Attorney General's Office has also been in contact with the lab in Virginia that processes the results of the untested sexual assault kits submitted through the SAFE Kits Initiative, and each step of the testing chain is continuing at normal pace. The lab has been deemed an essential business, and Marshall University, which conducts technical review of the lab results, are also continuing to work at normal pace. No slowdown in testing is expected, and the previous timeline should hold.

The SAFE Kits Initiative, funded by a grant administered by the Bureau of Justice Assistance, was launched by Attorney General Schmitt in January of 2019 to inventory all untested sexual assault kits in the backlog, create an electronic tracking system, and send those identified kits to a lab for forensic testing and potentially eventual prosecution.

Even in Music City, where music is a cornerstone of our economy and our cultural heritage, many musicians rely on a patchwork quilt of income sources. Those might include touring, playing on records, running sound at a venue — and often, another job or a parallel career. That other work needs to be flexible, which frequently means working in bars or restaurants. Since slowing the spread of COVID-19 means people can’t safely gather in public spaces, both the entertainment economy and the service economy have practically ground to a halt, and many music business folks have seen all of their income streams dry up at once.

Some musicians are playing livestream shows from home, with tips collected via online-pay apps — which are often divided among paying their bills, paying their bands and donating to relief funds. Venues have launched crowdfunding campaigns to cover their expenses and help support their employees. Organizations like MusiCares, a health-care-focused nonprofit started by the Recording Academy, have launched relief funds for music industry workers. MusiCares’ COVID-19 relief fund, established March 17, recently topped $10 million in donations. Despite Gov. Bill Lee’s initial hesitation about following the guidance of the CARES Act, he relented on April 7, and self-employed individuals (including musicians who work on a contract basis) are now able to file for unemployment benefits via the Tennessee Department of Labor and Workforce Development. This new support system, patchwork as it is, is encouraging. But the wait for the crisis to end is anything but comfortable.

“I see all these GoFundMes or these charities that are asking for donations, and I want to help these people,” Ryon Westover tells the Scene. “But at the same time, I’m one of these people.”

Westover, who records and plays with the heavy-psych band ElonMusk, made his living working the door and as a barback at East Nashville’s 3 Crow Bar, and tending bar at nearby venue The 5 Spot. His girlfriend Kalaway Voss worked at High Garden Tea. The deadly March 3 tornadoes destroyed High Garden, badly damaged 3 Crow and cut power to The 5 Spot, leaving both out of work. On March 23, Gov. Lee ordered all nonessential businesses closed. Westover and Voss are getting by for now, thanks to help from their families, deferred bills and aid from local nonprofit The Heartstrings Foundation. Still, uncertainty about when and how the pandemic will end leaves Westover concerned.

“I don’t know what it’s going to be like once we open back up and bands are playing shows again — if people are still going to be kind of wary … or if everyone is going to be straight back into it,” he says. “At the same time, I’m in a room with a whole ton of people, with the potential of getting sick or spreading things to other people.”

Larissa Maestro, a highly trained cellist and vocalist, has spent more than a decade establishing herself in Nashville’s music community and economy. Though she’s worked in restaurants before, until recently she had a schedule filled with music work. That included recording at studio sessions, writing string arrangements, performing with beloved ’90s tribute group My So-Called Band and a kaleidoscopic array of freelance performance gigs — most of which is on hold for now.

Maestro has received aid from MusiCares that’s helped with her mortgage, and her partner and bandmate Dan Sommers has a full-time job that he can do from home. She’s also attempted every day to file for unemployment, but has been frustrated by an overloaded system that’s been hastily retrofitted to serve self-employed workers. She points out how this has exposed serious flaws in the gig economy, which has always been a way of life for musicians, but has been an increasingly large part of the global economy in recent years.

“Even if we’re successful in our field — working really hard, making decent money and own our own home, all those things — we still don’t have a safety net,” Maestro says. “It’s ridiculous that self-employed people haven’t been able to apply for unemployment in the past, and the fact that they haven’t been able to means that the whole system is set up for them to not be able to access it. And now we need to access it, and we can’t.”"

Nicholas Braid, 35, died on Tuesday night after he allegedly became involved in an argument with a group of people outside the Beachcomber Resort in Surfers Paradise on the Gold Coast.

He was allegedly stabbed in the torso and collapsed on the footpath before he died later in hospital.

His accused killer, Freedom Mona Maunsell Anderson, 20, stuck her finger up at cameras and banged on the police car window as she was driven to Southport Watchhouse on Wednesday night following her arrest.

She was later charged with murder and remains behind bars.

Mr Braid's heartbroken family described his death as a senseless act.

Abigail Braid described her 'wonderful and amazing' older brother as brave and fiercely protective of his family.

He was also charming, intelligent and much loved.

'He adored my parents and was so good to them,' Ms Baird told Seven News.

'We love him so, so much. We will adore and cherish his memory forever. It's just a senseless tragedy all round.'

She thanked everyone on the family's behalf for their overwhelming support.

'I would like to, on behalf of all my family, really thank the members of the public who tended to Nick and paramedics for their valiant attempts to save his life,' Ms Braid said as she fought back tears.

'We've received so many beautiful messages from people sharing their wonderful and sometimes hilarious memories of Nick.

'We've really felt the support from everyone.'

Mr Braid, a former student of prestigious The Southport School, worked as an industrial relations advisor and also with the Queensland government after he graduated with law and international relations degrees.

He had been released on bail last week after several months in prison for a spate of thefts at fuel stations.

'Despite his struggles, he never stopped caring for them and always had compassion for the underdog,' his mother Michelle Braid told The Courier-Mail.

'His loyalty and generosity knew no bounds. He was known for his formidable intelligence and passionate eloquence. We are devastated.'

Friend Isabelle Marlor said she will cherish the 'happy' final moments she had with one of the kindest, sweetest guys she's have ever met on Monday night.

Mr Braid had been temporarily staying at her place before he died.

'It was nice to see him and I am glad I got to spend the time I did with him. The people that were around him at the time were stoked they got to spend the little time they did,' Ms Marlor, 21, told the Gold Coast Bulletin.

She first met Mr Braid eight years ago.

'I was 13 years old hanging out with people more than double my age, constantly putting myself in unsafe situations. Very few people cared about what happened to me back then. Even now at 21 years of age, few people care about me. But he was one of them,' Ms Marlor said.

It is believed Anderson and Mr Braid were loosely known to each other, and that she allegedly fled the scene on foot as the group scattered following the altercation.

Following a police search, she was arrested and charged with murder on Wednesday night.

Anderson did not appear when the matter was briefly mentioned in Southport Magistrates Court on Thursday.

The matter was adjourned for a committal mention on June 23 to allow detectives to continue their investigations.

'Obviously it's a very serious crime but this matter needs to be resolved,' Anderson's lawyer Michael Gatenby told Seven News.

'We'll give consideration to bringing an application for bail.'

Detectives continue to investigate whether smashed windows or if a 'wilful damage' incident could have led to Mr Braid's death.

The weapon has not been located although it appeared to be an 'edged weapon, like a knife or something similar', police said."

He was reported to have a fishing rod with him and he was riding his bicycle.”

St. Johns County deputies were on the lookout for the stolen Tundra with a Pennsylvania license tag when it was spotted about 12:45 p.m. and stopped in a Publix parking lot in Ponte Vedra Beach near TPC Sawgrass, Sheriff David Shoar said. Pennsylvania police had indicated that it had video footage showing the truck being stolen by a man with a shotgun, Shoar said.

As Deputy Cameron Coward approached the truck, a man inside jumped out and began firing a shotgun at him, Shoar said. The deputy fired back, then waited for backup as the man got back in the truck. The man was injured and not moving for a long time as a SWAT team was called in to take over.

It is still unclear if the man suffered a self-inflicted wound or was hit by the deputy’s gunfire, the Sheriff’s Office said Thursday. But when SWAT members approached the truck, they found Bonsell critically wounded inside.

The incident caused a security lockdown of the area around the Sawgrass shopping center.

This is the second St. Johns deputy-involved shooting of the year. Last month deputies shot and killed a man after he led them on a chase and began firing back at them."

The UK is in lockdown as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with footballers forced to train at home on their own.

UK Government guidelines state that individuals are only allowed to leave the house for essential food and medicine and daily exercise - which must be taken while adhering to social distancing rules.

However, according to ​The Sun, a selection of Arsenal players have flouted these guidelines.

David Luiz and Granit Xhaka were spotted having a kick about together in a field in Southgate, north London on Tuesday.

Pepe meanwhile joined in a game on an astroturf pitch in Collingdale's Graham Park on 15 April, which he shared on Instagram.

An Arsenal spokesperson told the Sun: "" We’ll be speaking to our players.

“We were concerned so we have spoken to Nicolas who shares a house with a number of relatives who were involved in this game.

“We have reminded him of the importance of everyone following the guidelines.”

Ignoring government guidelines during lockdown is becoming a common theme in north London, after Tottenham duo Serge Aurier and Moussa Sissoko were forced to ​​make a public apology on Tuesday for training together. Aurier had posted a video of the pair training together on social media.

At the beginning of April, Spurs boss Jose Mourinho had ​led by example when he held a training session for

Aston Villa captain Jack Grealish was also ​forced to apologise after flouting the government's guidelines to go and visit his former teammate Ross McCormack, and was caught out after being involved in a minor car accident.

Pepe, Luiz or Xhaka are yet to make a public apology, and Arsenal are yet to release an official statement regarding the matter."

According to a press release from Poornaprajna Amateur Astronomers’ Club, the wonder will commence and people will see their shadows disappear for a few moments at 12:28 pm.

The phenomenon is called as Zero Shadow Day. If a person takes a candle in a dark room and use it to create a shadow of one’s palm on the wall, the hand will cast shadow on the wall as one moves the hand. But when one places the palm on the wall, there will be no shadow.

In the phenomenon, the sun at these times shines exactly above the heads on these days. In astronomy, this point is called as Zenith. The point in the sky directly above an observer at any given location. So it is quite clear now that on Zero Shadow Day, the sun passes through the Zenith as a result of which, all objects will have minimal or no shadow if they are on the ground.

The reason for this happens on some specific days is concerned with astronomy. The earth spins around on its own axis and causes days and nights. It also revolves around the sun causing a year. But the seasons are caused because the axis is tilted at an angle of 23.5 degrees. It is because of this tilt that the sun rises every day in the east gradually moving towards the north till June 21st and then slowly proceeding towards the south till December 21st every year. “We call these days solstice. This means the sun shines between the Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn every day passing by the equator on the days we call equinox,” the release stated.

As the earth moves around the sun and revolves on its own axis, for all the people between Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn, the Sun at noon moves father and closer to the zenith passing through zenith twice causing two Zero Shadow Days per year. People at Mangaluru will observe this on April 24 and August 18 every year and People in Udupi will observe this on April 25 and August 17 every year.

Places with same latitudes will observe the same days of Zero Shadow but the time would vary with longitude. For example, people of Bengaluru as they share the latitude with Mangaluru will also observe it on April 24. While the people of Mangaluru will observe their shadows disappear at 12.28pm, people of Bengaluru will observe this at 12:17pm. Places like Moodabidri, Bantwal, Sakleshpur and Hassan will also observe Zero Shadow on April 24.

Places like Brahmavar, Karkala, Sringeri, Kudremukha, Chikkamagaluru will observe the Zero Shadow Day on the same day as Udupi on April 25."

753,753,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/2020/04/22/britain-behind-curve-coronavirus-drug-vaccine-trials/,Britain is behind the curve on coronavirus drug and vaccine trials,Human trials of a vaccine are beginning tomorrow overseen by laboratories in Oxford and London in what Matt Hancock has rightly called the best way to beat the coronavirus.,www.telegraph.co.uk,"Human trials of a vaccine are beginning tomorrow overseen by laboratories in Oxford and London in what Matt Hancock has rightly called the best way to beat the coronavirus. The Government is spending £42 million to support the trials as part of a global effort to develop a way of stopping the spread of the contagion.

But while getting to this stage so quickly is a testament to the extraordinary efforts of scientists and the urgency of the task, there is no guarantee that a vaccine will be developed and, if it is, it will not be available for many months. Given the damage to the economy, it is simply not feasible to continue the lockdown until one is found. There will have to be a gradual easing of restrictions accompanied by measures to suppress transmission while people try to get back to something approaching normal life.

One way is through contact tracing, and yet here the UK seems to be behind the curve. A small team of tracers was wound down while the focus moved to a smartphone app, but the Government wants to build it up again.

Treatment is another element to the fight that may reap dividends. So far, no one has found a drug guaranteed to ameliorate the symptoms, but this is likely to happen before a vaccine is available, which could be a year away.

More than 150 drugs are being researched around the world, including by the UK’s recovery programme with 5,000 participants. Some trials are using blood plasma from those who have had the disease in a bid to create antibodies. The World Health Organisation has identified remdesivir, used to treat Ebola, as a potentially effective treatment. This is not part of the UK trials. Why not?"
754,754,https://www.pr-inside.com/ipsos-first-quarter-results-r4794610.htm,Ipsos: First Quarter Results,Ipsos: First Quarter Results,www.pr-inside.com,"Paris, April 23, 2020 – In Q1 2020, Ipsos posted revenue of €428.7 million, slightly up on the same period last year.

This incorporated the positive effect (+0.8%) of two acquisitions during the quarter. These have already been announced: the Mystery Shopping business of the US company Maritz and the French company ASKIA, which develops software solutions tailored to the needs of research firms such as Ipsos.

Exchange rate effects were also positive (+0.8%).

At constant exchange rates and scope, revenue was flat year-on-year.

Breaking down by region, growth was strong in the Americas and more particularly in the US (+5%). Conversely, it fell 10% in Asia-Pacific due to the very negative performance in China (-25%) caused by the early lockdown.

*Breakdown of Service Lines by audience segment: the analysis of the breakdown of revenue by audience segment is classified as non-financial data, and is likely to change over time in line with changes in the structure of Ipsos’ teams.

In terms of audience segments, there are significant differences between 2019 and 2020.
• Revenue from services targeted at specific groups such as customers and employees was down 5%. Many companies in sectors that are heavily impacted by the pandemic discontinued their research work because of a lack of customers. This is true of hotel chains, airlines and other service companies.
• Services involving consumer research were also hit, particularly in March. Many companies, surprised by the scope and breadth of the crisis naturally suspended research around, for example, new product or service launches, asking themselves what markets look like now and what they will look like once the health crisis has been tackled, or even ended.
• Two audience segments are up. They are both directly linked to the pandemic:

Public authorities in many countries want to know people’s lives in such unusual times. They are also looking to properly understand how they can shape their communications and encourage people to respect health guidelines designed to contain the epidemic. In parallel, they are also ramping up measurement systems that will give them reliable data on key issues, such as the number of people who were exposed to the virus and who, through serological tests, are showing signs of immunity.

The Ipsos performance in these audience segments would have been even stronger had certain social research programs, involving face-to-face survey protocols, not been curtailed in March to comply with lockdown rules. Many of these programs will be restarted as soon as possible where the data collection protocols can be adapted. In some cases that offer the same quality assurances, interviews can be done by telephone with people who are confined at home rather than face-to-face. In certain cases, however, face-to-face survey protocols need to be maintained and it is thus a matter of waiting to restart them until this is once again feasible.

Pharmaceutical firms have also been active. Ipsos developed a series of initiatives for them both related and unrelated to the pandemic and the health impact.

OTHER INFORMATION ABOUT BUSINESS CONDITIONS IN Q1

Profitability was down around 100 basis points year-on-year, given the sudden slump in business from mid-March. This abrupt decline meant we weren't able to cut costs proportionally because they are partly fixed and were in line with projected growth to that point for 2020.

In contrast, free cash flow from operating activities was in line with forecasts for Q1 and particularly high on the back of the strong sales at end-2019, reflected in inflows this quarter.

The company invested close to €12 million in two acquisitions (Maritz Mystery Shopping and Askia) in Q1. These two companies were consolidated as from February 1, 2020.

The net debt ratio was 47.4% at March 31, 2020, down from 51.5% at December 31, 2019 and 52.9% at March 31, 2019.

The company has a strong cash position with €230 million in cash, not to mention around €500 million in undrawn bank facilities. This will allow it to meet its debt repayments in 2020 and 2021.

The situation hasn't changed since the press release of April 8, 2020, which stated that following a very positive start to the year, despite disappointing performances in a number of Asian markets and in particular China, since the third week of March Ipsos has been operating in a highly changed market.

There has been a significant fall in orders with the twin effect of fewer new orders than last year and a substantial level of cancellations and above all suspensions and postponements.

The magnitude communicated on April 8 was reaffirmed during the first three weeks of April (week 14, beginning March 30 and ending April 5, week 15 and week 16): New orders were down 10% on last year whereas the net order book (new orders net of cancellations and postponements during the period) was at 40% of what it was in the same weeks of 2019. It is likely that this trend, with perhaps fewer cancellations and postponements, will continue until we move out of the Great Lockdown into a period where the most restrictive measures are removed.This will be gradual but nonetheless real.

Until then, Ipsos will see sales negatively affected by:
• The difficulties faced by clients themselves;
• The uncertainty created by the epidemic, in particular regarding the length of the lockdown and the subsequent length of restrictions not to mention concerns about what will follow;
• The consequences of the lockdown and operational impossibility for Ipsos to work on certain programs, particularly where people need to be surveyed in person.

Ipsos is optimistic that the services and information provided to public authorities, companies and other organizations are critical and will be viewed as such during the various phases leading up to a return to “normal” life for everyone.

That said, Ipsos is realistic and has been proactive:
• Steps were taken in March to control the cost base and bring it into line with actual business levels. The primary goal, amongst others, is to preserve the company's strong cash position. The decision to cut the dividend in half is based on the same rationale.
• The solutions that Ipsos offers its clients have been or will shortly be adapted to reflect the technical and material constraints created by the Great Lockdown and the restrictive measures that will likely be in place for months. They are, insofar as possible, more digital, agile, quicker. They make it possible to obtain the accurate measurements and fresh information companies and organizations need. The Great Lockdown is reflective of the extent of the crisis. It is also, however, a major accelerator of innovation and of transformation in the methods and processes used to collect data.
• There is a particular focus on internal training, client communication and the functioning of collaborative platforms. These are trying and difficult times for everyone. There is considerable need to adapt. In fact, it is easy to order a company's employees to work from home, but it is much more complex to ensure that, under these conditions, the work that must be done is done as efficiently as before. Ipsos continues to manage thousands of projects, survey millions of people, collect and analyze content from hundreds of thousands of websites and social media sources. Every day and in every region, Ipsos’ teams act as spokespeople for consumers / citizens and clients.

Lastly, Ipsos is closely monitoring the speed of market recovery and type of demand - new or not - in countries that were never fully locked down, such as South Korea, or that are coming out of lockdown, such as China.

In five weeks, at the General Shareholders’ Meeting of Ipsos SA, which will be held behind closed doors on May 28, Ipsos will provide further updates on market conditions and business activity.

Ipsos is the third largest market research company in the world, present in 90 markets and employing more than 18,000 people.

Our passionately curious research professionals, analysts and scientists have built unique multi-specialist capabilities that provide true understanding and powerful insights into the actions, opinions and motivations of citizens, consumers, patients, customers or employees.

According to a recent editorial in the Chicago Sun-Times, “health outcomes in the United States have never been fair and equal, not in Chicago or anywhere else. And there has never been health care equity. Black folks have always suffered from higher rates of dangerous medical conditions such as hypertension and diabetes, that correlate with lower incomes and poorer health.”

The Los Angeles Times weighed in by telling its readers that “because of poverty and other barriers, African Americans are less likely to have access to medical care and they’re more likely to live in neighborhoods where markets selling fresh, nutritious food are scarce.”

Not to be outdone by larger markets, The Courier Journal, the Herald-Leader and myriad of television and radio stations have detailed the problem here in the commonwealth citing many of the same social determinants of health listed above.

More: COVID-19 hitting Louisville African Americans, Asians harder, but not at nation's levels

As two African American nurse leaders, we are glad that the news media is reporting about disparities in the incidents and consequences of COVID-19, and we are encouraged that our governor was among the first to report the race of COVID-19 victims. However, we need more.

These disparities were predictable and a more proactive public health approach to ensure that messaging and resources were strategically directed to vulnerable populations, such as blacks who suffer a disproportionate burden of poor health, is called for. Now is the time for nurse leaders trained to identify problems to advocate for culturally appropriate evidence-based solutions to prevent further COVID-19 disparities.

We applaud Gov. Beshear’s quick and decisive action to enforce social distancing measures to protect the health of Kentuckians. However, we urge Kentucky’s nurses to view these measures through a culturally sensitive lens. African American culture is strongly grounded in faith, family and fellowship — all of which are currently restricted to protect public health.

As restrictions are encouraged, we urge Kentucky nurses to recognize that while compliance is a challenge for everyone, the cultural context of compliance are varied, and we caution nurses to avoid perpetuating a narrative that seems to blame black people for dying. For instance, consider compliance with instructions to remain home and to wash our hands for individuals who may be homeless or to avoid attending worship for individuals whose only social outlet and source of strength may be the church community. We as nurses are well aware that masks are in short supply. So let’s consider that many among us, including individuals from lower socioeconomic status, do not have access or means to obtain masks.

So, when we see African Americans and others congregating on a nice spring day, let’s consider the many reasons that this may occur. While many populations laud the heroic efforts of health care professionals, note that because of the history of denied access and mistreatment inflicted by the health care system, many black Americans have a deep mistrust of the profession.

Recall also that it has only been in recent days that reporters began to highlight racial disparities among COVID-19 victims and that the faces of early COVID-19 victims and of those reporting the dire numbers did not reflect the diverse images of the populations suffering from infection. The early representation of the impact of the virus may have perpetuated a myth among some populations that COVID-19 did not affect people of color when in fact the opposite is true — people of color are the most likely among us to die from this virus.

As such, let’s promote culturally appropriate strategies — let’s urge African Americans to protect themselves by following the CDC and Gov. Beshear, (kycovid19.ky.gov). Let’s urge our Kentucky nurse colleagues to provide culturally sensitive messaging and care and to advocate for appropriate messaging and priority access to COVID-19 testing for America’s most vulnerable populations. As we move beyond the current health crisis, let us revisit efforts that address the root cause of social iniquities.

Now is the time!

757,757,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/features/Ghanaian-attitude-an-enemy-to-good-governance-932797,"Ghanaian attitude, an enemy to good governance",2020-04-23 -,www.ghanaweb.com,"Our divergent views on every Public Policy decision in Ghana makes one begin to understand why former President John Mahama a few years ago opined to some officials of the New Patriotic Party not to criticize him since they were not in his position as President. Upon sober reflection, even though it may sound undemocratic, one could comprehend that in as a much we all have opinions, the decision-making table in Ghana cannot make available seats for everybody and accommodate all ideas shared by the citizens. 

 

 I could not agree better with the American newspaper columnist, George Ade, when he asserted that, “the cream of all jobs is to perch on the fence and tell the other feller how to saw woods”. Decision making in Ghana somehow not difficult but when opinions try to take the seat of evidence and facts, it worsens decision implementation. 

 

 Looking back in school days lectures on “Governance and Politics of Public Policy”, an interesting debate on how governance is a serious business whereas those who are not on playing field sees it as a walk-in park. 

 

 The pronouncement by President Akufo-Addo regarding the lifting of the ban on the partial lockdown may have come as a surprise to Ghanaians but it is important to consider the reasons behind his decision which was cleverly outlined in his speech, supported by data and science with forward-looking proposals including the mandatory wearing of mask to cover both nose and mouth and enforcement of social distancing. Remember, the decision to unlock the affected regions could not have been as an easy one and it is not every policy that requires comments from everyone but experts without addressing it with political spectacles. 

 

 Since the lockdown started, there have been countless of cases of recalcitrance including market centers, commercial vehicle drivers, churches, food vendors and with some, it took the intervention of the security personnel’s to “put the fear of God” in them before they adhered to the President’s directives. People even travelled to regions that were not experiencing lockdown and for crying out loud if they were carriers of the virus which unknowingly, affected those they came into contact with because most of the COVID 19 cases are asymptomatic and the virus moves when we move. 

 

 I begin to contemplate why we should struggle with a decision that is meant for the general good of the people. We have cried because of the restricted movement posed by the lockdown but we are the same people questioning the President of why he lifted the ban. In as much as we are scared of the increasing COVID 19 cases in the country, the time is due for us to prepare and do the right thing to support decision making. 

 

 Meanwhile, a statement issued by the Ghana Pentecostal and Charismatic Council on April 20, 2020, specified their support for the President in relaxing the 3 weeks lockdown especially for the many Ghanaians who are in the informal sector of the economy. Additionally, the Trade Union Congress, TUC, has also indicated that it was the right decision given the dire economic consequences of prolonged restriction. 

 

 Be that as it may, COVID-19 has found its way to more than 100 countries and till date, no proper medication has been found by even the greatest scientists and virologists in the world. This however shows that, coronavirus is and will continue to live with us for some time and innovative strategies including the precautionary measure by World Health Organization must be deployed by Ghanaians in order to comfortably sit with the virus and dine on the same table without the fear of being infected. We must tighten our boots very well because the journey of fighting the virus is very far a distance!

 

 South Korea, on April 15, 2020, had their Presidential and Parliamentary elections and one would wonder how they were able to successfully conduct the election despite the concern of coronavirus outbreak. The election, according to StraitsTimes.com had the highest voter turnout for the past 20 years. If you asked me, I will say, they had a good strategy which was implemented with discipline by the citizens. At the time of the election, South Korea had recorded 10,591 of COVID-19 cases and 225 deaths but they were able to adhere to the strict measures put in place by the government such as 2m social distance and disinfection of the booth and stamp after every vote. Provisions were made for every citizen who qualified to cast their ballot including those affected with the coronavirus.

 

 Ghanaians can easily practice discipline if we are committed to doing so and we should not allow the fear of indiscipline to take away our capabilities of exercising what is best for us as a people. It is said that, when the going gets tough, the tough get going, so Ghanaians must begin to put into action the discipline, sacrifice and above all, limit our persistent attitude of complaining in all matters and support the President in discharging his duties at this tough moment.

 

 When the decision to partially lockdown the Greater Kumasi and Accra some 21 days ago, a lot of Ghanaians for some reasons best known to them came up with strong concerns to either support or denounce the President instructions. There is no denial about its implications on business and other economic activities and this is the time to rethink new ways of doing things with discipline.

 

 No matter how much we lambast the President for lifting the stay-at-home order, he has already done so, and we have to look ahead as we prepare to live together with the virus whiles we continue to undertake our daily economic and social activities, discipline should guide our endeavours because the President has done his part and the onus lies on us as citizens to put our discipline to reality check. 

 

 Therefore, “be a citizen, not a spectator” expression, is not applicable to this issue if you are not an expert so let us shelve our opinions for now and allow data and evidence to do the talking because the devil we are dealing with is purely scientific. The “I think we should do this and that” must stop for the meantime for the President to think through and make right decisions informed by science, data and the experience of medical professionals so to save lives and get the country back to work!!"

The study, created by academics at the Hong Kong University School of Public Health and published in the Lancet, found that more than 230,000 people were likely infected in the first wave of the outbreak, whereas official Chinese data recorded just 55,000 cases as of Feb. 20.

China has reported just 83,878 cases of COVID-19 so far and just 4,636 fatalities, according to numbers aggregated by Johns Hopkins University. Those numbers have been treated with skepticism by many health officials and analysts, given that the illness was first reported late last year from the city of Wuhan, which was subjected to strict quarantine measures that were only lifted last week.

China has changed its approach on whom is counted over time and initially did not include patients who were asymptomatic or showed milder symptoms. Last week, China increased the death toll in Wuhan by 50%. The study found the numbers would be far higher if the country had used its most recent approach consistently from the start.

In the U.S., President Donald Trump said he did not approve of Georgia’s decision to restart its economy and told Gov. Brian Kemp so in a phone call. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s leading infectious-disease expert who appeared at Wednesday's White House briefing for the first time this week, agreed and cautioned the state to move more slowly.

The head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, meanwhile, said he did not intend to suggest in comments to the Washington Post that the coronavirus is likely to re-emerge as an even deadlier threat in the winter. Robert Redfield said he meant that the coronavirus and the flu would be a deadly combination if they are circulating at the same time and urged all Americans to get flu shots in the fall to help mitigate the danger.

In another controversy, Trump claimed not to know a doctor who was removed from his post as director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority and shuffled off to another position with less influence. The agency, known as BARDA and housed within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is on the front lines of vaccine development to treat COVID-19 and other deadly illnesses.

Dr. Rick Bright claimed he was pushed out for political reasons because he opposed funding to study chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, a pair of long-used malaria drugs touted by Trump as a potential life saver for COVID-19 patients. So far the little research that has been done has been inconclusive, with one limited study indicating they were not effective.

“I don’t know who he is,” Trump said. “Guy says he was pushed out of a job. Maybe he was, maybe he wasn’t.”

Bright also accused members of the Trump administration of pressuring them to “fund companies with political connections” and asked for the an independent inquiry into his removal. He did not name any companies.

In Nevada, officials rushed to condemn comments made by Las Vegas Mayor Carolyn Goodman suggesting the city could act as a test case to measure the impact of the virus by reopening casinos, restaurants and small businesses and allowing conventions again.

“I offered to be a control group, and I was told by our statistician you can’t do that because people from all parts of southern Nevada come in to work in the city,” Goodman said in an interview with Anderson Cooper on CNN. “We would love to be that placebo side so you have something to measure against.”

The casino workers Culinary Union, which represents about 60,000 bartenders, cooks, housekeepers and other workers, said Goodman’s remarks were “outrageous considering essential frontline workers have been dealing with the consequences of this crisis firsthand.”

There are now 2.67 million cases of COVID-19 worldwide and 183,131 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins data. At least 727,170 people have recovered.

The U.S. has the highest case toll in the world at 856,209 and the highest death toll at 47,272. New York remains the U.S. epicenter with more than 257,000 cases and more than 19,000 deaths, the data shows.

Spain has the highest number of cases in Europe at 213,024 and 22,157 deaths. Italy has 189,973 cases and 25,549 deaths, the highest number of fatalities in Europe.

France has 157,135 cases and 21,889 deaths, while Germany has 151,195 cases and just 5,367 deaths. The U.K. has 139,245 cases and 18,791 deaths. Turkey has 101,790 cases and 2,491 deaths, followed by Iran with 87,026 cases and 5,481 deaths.

The growth in the number of Americans applying for jobless benefits eased slightly from a week earlier but remained alarming, with another 4.4 million applicants pushing the number above 26 million since the pandemic started to force states and local governments enforce strict stay-at-home and other social-distancing rules.

The spike in unemployment has likely pushed the jobless rate to between 15% and 20%, economists estimate. The only other time in American history when unemployment was that high was in the early stages of the Great Depression almost a century ago.

In less than two months, the pandemic has eliminated all the 23 million jobs created after the 2007–09 Great Recession.

Separately, the IHS Market flash purchasing managers index for services in April fell to a record low, while the manufacturing PMI weakened to the lowest level in 11 years. The flash services PMI fell to 27 from 39.8 in March, while the manufacturing PMI dropped to 36.9 from 48.5. Any reading below 50 indicates worsening conditions. The “flash” reading is based on approximately 85% of the final number of replies received each month.

New-home sales fell 15% in March to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 627,000, according to the monthly report from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Department of Housing and Urban Development.

What are companies saying?

In company news, U.K. drug company AstraZeneca AZN, said it will start a clinical study evaluating its diabetes drug Farxiga in 900 patients hospitalized with severe cases of COVID-19 who may be risk of organ failure. The randomized, global, Phase 3 trial will be conducted at Saint Luke’s Mid America Heart Institute in Kansas City, Mo., as well as at sites in Europe.

Two analysts said they expect Apple Inc. AAPL, to maintain an aggressive share-buyback program in the face of the pandemic, even as other companies are halting or suspending theirs to conserve cash. The stimulus bill that passed in March bans companies that accept aid from buying back their own shares until a year after they’re repaid their loans.

Apple has about $100 billion in cash and has pledged to become net cash neutral “over time.”

Walt Disney Co. had its credit rating downgraded by S&P Global Ratings by one notch to A-minus, with analysts citing the fact that its theme parks are closed indefinitely and all TV and film production is on hold.

Domino’s Pizza emerged as another pandemic survivor given strong demand for pizza, beating profit and sales expectations for the first quarter.

Target Corp. said April same-store sales are up 5% so far, boosted by demand for essentials and food and beverage, that weighed against declining demand for apparel and accessories. Target is extending a wage high for frontline workers until at least May 2.

Elsewhere, companies continued to furlough workers, cut costs, defer nonessential spending and tap credit lines.

Here’s the latest on what companies are saying about COVID-19:
• Alcoa Corp. AA, has halted its global quarterly supply-and-demand projections on the alumina, aluminum and bauxite markets because of the pandemic. The company ended the first quarter with $829 million in cash and debt of $1.8 billion, for net debt of $973 million. All of its bauxite mines, alumina refineries, aluminum smelters, casthouses, energy assets and its rolling mill remain operational, it said.
• Boston Beer Co. SAM, missed consensus estimates for the first quarter and took a revenue hit during the pandemic. The maker of Samuel Adams Boston Lager and other beers pulled its 2020 guidance and said it has seen reduced keg demand and higher labor and safety costs. Revenue took at $10 million hit in the quarter due to $5.8 million worth of keg returns, and $4.2 million in direct costs. The company has shifted more volume to third-party breweries, which has increased production costs and impacted margins.
• Beyond Meat Inc. BYND, has entered into a $150 million, five-year secured revolving credit facility to help fund future growth projects. The credit facility includes an accordion feature for up to an additional $200 million.

• Cooper Tire & Rubber Co. CTB, will begin the process of reopening and ramping up production at its manufacturing facilities in the U.S. next week. The facilities, which have been closed for about five weeks as a result of the pandemic, include locations in Findlay, Ohio; Clarksdale and Tupelo, Miss.; and Texarkana, Ark. The tire maker has to close its Mexico plant again starting April 28 (it was reopened on April 13) after the Mexico government determined the plant was a nonessential business. The company will reopen its plant in Krusevac, Serbia, while its Melksham, England, plant remains closed.
• Crocs Inc. CROX, missed profit and revenue estimates for the first quarter as stores were shuttered during the coronavirus pandemic. The Niwot, Colo.–based company ‘s adjusted per-share earnings came to 22 cents, below the 31 cents FactSet consensus. Revenue slid to $281.2 million from $295.9 million, also below the FactSet consensus of $296 million. The company withdrew 2020 guidance provided on Feb. 27 because of the uncertainty caused by the virus, but expects revenue declines to continue in the retail and wholesale channels as long as social-distancing measures remain in effect. Crocs has no near-term liquidity concerns and has taken measures to preserve cash. The company has furloughed store workers, cut executive and board pay and deferred certain spending. Its distribution centers remain operational with strict cleaning protocols in place. Capex for 2020 is expected at about $30 million, down from earlier guidance of $50 million to $60 million. The company has increased a credit facility with PNC Bank, National Association and other lenders to $500 million from $450 million and eased covenants for the second and third quarters. It has temporarily suspended share buybacks.
• Entertainment giant Endeavor Group Holdings Inc. is planning more cutbacks in the coming week, including staff furloughs and pay cuts that will affect about one-third of its 7,500 employees, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing a company spokesman. The company has already had layoffs and salary cuts. The pandemic has disrupted many of Endeavor’s businesses, which include talent management through WME and live events, including mixed-martial-arts organization UFC, along with other sporting events and beauty pageants. Last month, the company laid off 250 employees, including restaurant workers and groundskeepers. Chief Executive Ari Emanuel and Executive Chairman Patrick Whitesell will go without pay this year.
• Expedia Group Inc. EXPE, is raising $3.2 billion in new capital, in an effort to boost financial flexibility and liquidity. The online travel company will implement furloughs and reduced work week programs, suspend matching 401(k) contributions and the CEO and board members will forgo cash compensation for the rest of the year. The new capital will consist of $1.2 billion in a private placement of perpetual preferred stock and $2 billion in new debt financing. Apollo Global Management Inc. and Silver Lake are providing the equity investment. Separately, the company named Vice Chairman Peter Kern as its CEO and Acting CFO Eric Hart as permanent CFO.
• Gap Inc. GPS, has suspended rent payments totaling $115 million in North America and is in talks to renegotiate or even terminate leases and close stores entirely. If the company is unable to change lease terms, it could be deemed to be in default. Gap has drawn down its full $500 million revolving credit facility and at the end of the fiscal quarter on May 2, expects to have $750 million to $850 million in cash. The retailer expects to take other measures to preserve and add to its liquidity, including canceling orders, cutting staff and expenditures further, among others. The ailing apparel company has furloughed the majority of its workers in the U.S. and Canada and cut corporate head count. It has cut capital expenditures by $300 million, withdrawn guidance for the full year, suspended stock repurchases and cut pay for the board and leadership team.
• Mack-Cali Realty Corp. CLI, , a real-estate investment trust focused on waterfront office and residential properties, has collected 96% of residential tenant rent for April and 90% of office rent. The news comes after New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy’s executive order earlier this month, in which nonessential construction was to ceased and essential businesses were to adopt aggressive social-distancing and disinfection measures. “It is not known at this time whether the Governor’s executive order will be extended and what, if any, impact it may have on future rent collections, and past performance and April 2020 rent collections to date are not indicative of future results,” the company said.
• Snap Inc. SNAP, plans to offer $750 million in convertible notes that would mature on May 1, 2025. The notes will be offered in a private placement to institutional buyers who will have the option to purchase an addition $112.5 million in notes. Snap expects to use the proceeds from this convertible sale for general corporate purchases, including operating expenses as well as capital expenditures, with the option to also use the funding for acquisitions or share buybacks, though the company currently has no plans for either.
• Target Corp. TGT, same-store sales so far in April have increased more than 5% from a year ago, as a “midteens” percentage decline in store sales was more than offset by a near four-fold jump (up 275%) in digital sales. Same-store sales fell 40% in apparel and accessories month to date, but rose more than 12% in essentials and food and beverage, more than 30% in hardlines and in the high teens in home. That follows same-store sales growth of 3.8% in February and an increase in the low double digits in March. The company still expects profitability to be negatively impacted by factors including category mix shift to lower-margin products, inventory write downs, and investments in pay and benefits. Target is extending its $2-an-hour wage increase until May 30, for frontline employees working amid the pandemic. The company had previously said the wage hike would last until at least May 2."

Emirati modest wear influencer Lana Hattab’s self-isolation experience has “heightened” her ability to feel gratitude. She is not letting the current situation get to her and is being active and is staying social — just like always.

How has self-isolation been for you so far?

In short, it has been an eye-opening experience. I have had the time to teach myself different hobbies and to focus on my personal well-being by meditating every morning. Self-isolation has, in particular, heightened my ability to feel gratitude. We are blessed to be in the UAE, a country that goes above and beyond and cares for its citizens and residents and has set a global standard in these unprecedented times.

Staying in and adapting to this lifestyle. Life was busy and fast-paced as such the biggest challenge was extracting myself from my full-on daily routine and slowing down.

What is something positive that has happened due to self-isolation in your life?

As mentioned above, I have had the time to develop my hobbies and personal interests, spend more time with my family, learn new cooking/baking recipes, read, film for my online platforms and work out. These are all things I’ve always wanted to dedicate time to but could not.

What are you currently watching in self-isolation?

What are you eating? Have you tried cooking anything new?

I have more home-cooked meals now, which is very different from my regular lifestyle — I would eat out almost every day. I am also exploring other cuisines and cooking different recipes.

How are you keeping sane as you stay home?

I plan the day based on how I’m feeling in the morning. Some days my schedule is busy (guitar practice, learning something new, etc.). On others, it is less hectic and more chill. This flexibility allows me to diversify my routine and makes it more interesting.

How are you keeping fit?

I tune in to live classes on Instagram like “physique57,” and sometimes go on the bike for 20-30 minutes a day.

How are you staying “social”?

I video call my family and friends every single day and connect using social media.

Choose the right time to read. Learn or read something new if you’re bored, but give yourself a break if you are unmotivated. I have bought a kindle to make it easier for me to read books now.

In self-isolation, are you relaxed or do you feel the need to be extra productive?

A bit of both depending on the day.

Are you living in your PJS, or taking the time to get dressed up?

I dress up and put some makeup on to feel better."

762,762,https://scvnews.com/california-western-states-plan-to-resume-delayed-medical-care/,"California, Western States Plan to Resume Delayed Medical Care",Governor Newsom announced plans to allow hospitals and health systems to resume medical care delayed by an anticipated surge of COVID-19 patients.,scvnews.com,"SACRAMENTO — California Governor Gavin Newsom on Wednesday announced plans to allow hospitals and health systems to resume delayed medical care for Californians – such as heart valve replacements, angioplasty and tumor removals, and key preventive care services, such as colonoscopies – which were deferred as the state’s health care delivery systems prepared for a surge of COVID-19 patients.

The decision was based on progress toward preparing California hospitals and health systems for a surge in COVID-19 patients – one of the six critical indicators the governor unveiled last week as part of the state’s framework for gradually modifying California’s stay-at-home order.

As part of the Western States Pact, California will work with Washington and Oregon to share best practices on how the three states can allow hospitals and medical providers to resume delayed medical care in areas that have sufficient hospital capacity, while ensuring the safety and health of our health care workers and patients.

The Western states had previously announced a shared, science-based vision for gradually reopening their economies and controlling COVID-19 into the future.

“From the beginning, I have said California’s decisions will be guided by science, not politics, and that Californians’ health comes first,” Newsom said.

“Thanks to the work our health care delivery system has done expanding hospital capacity and reducing the rate of spread of COVID-19, hospitals and health systems can consider resuming medical care that residents have delayed during this crisis, such as heart valve replacements, angioplasty and tumor removals, when such care can be delivered safety and with appropriate protections for health care workers,” he said. “It’s in the best interest of the overall health of our state to allow these procedures to resume when they can be done safely.”

Last week, Newsom announced six indicators that would drive California’s decision to gradually modify portions of the state’s stay-at-home order.

* Expanding testing and contact tracing to be able to identify and isolate those with the virus;

* Preventing infection in people who are most at risk;

* Being able to handle surges in hospitals and the health care delivery system;

* Ensuring businesses, schools and child care facilities can support physical distancing; and

* Determining when to reinstate certain measures like the stay-at-home order if need be.

Also Wednesday, Newsom announced that President Trump has personally committed to sending the state 100,000 testing swabs next week and 250,000 swabs the following week.

Health officials also outlined progress toward the first indicator: expanding testing and contact tracing to be able to identify and isolate those with the virus.

To that end, the state announced the expansion of community testing in underserved areas. The state is contracting with Verily, an Alphabet company, in partnership with Community Organized Relief Effort (CORE) and with support from Rockefeller Foundation and an anonymous donor, to establish six new community testing sites focused on underserved communities such as farmworkers and communities of color.

Additionally, the state is contracting with OptumServe, to establish an additional 80 community testing sites, which too will be focused on underserved communities.

“We know that communities of color are disproportionately affected by COVID-19,” said Governor Newsom. “We must ensure that we are deploying testing equitably in an effort to reduce the higher death rates we are seeing in African American and Latino communities.”

In addition, the state is:

* Accelerating equitable COVID-19 testing by aiming to deploy 25,000 tests per day by April 30; establishing an additional 80-100 testing sites; and identifying five new high-throughput testing hubs.

* Establishing a contact tracing workforce by surveying counties on their capacity; developing a statewide training academy; and training 10,000 public health connectors to conduct contact tracing.

* Developing isolation protocols and supports by identifying regional alternate isolation sites and building private-public partnerships to support those who are isolated.

* Deploying data management system and tools by publishing a symptom-check app; deploying a data management platform; and establishing a data dashboard for the public.

Now that testing has become more widely available across the state, California updated its testing guidance earlier this week to become the first state to recommend testing of some asymptomatic individuals such as health care workers, first responders and correctional workers.

This action will better protect Californians and prevent COVID-19 spread in high-risk settings such as congregate living facilities and correctional facilities."
763,763,https://whdh.com/news/mass-families-with-children-in-national-school-lunch-program-to-receive-additional-assistance-with-food-security/,Mass. families with children in National School Lunch Program to receive additional assistance with food security,,whdh.com,"BOSTON (WHDH) - Families in Massachusetts whose children got free or reduced-price meals at school through the National School Lunch Program will receive additional assistance to help them with food security.

The Baker-Polito Administration announced Thursday that they gained federal approval to promote increased food security through an initiative called Pandemic EBT, or P-EBT, for the more than 500,000 students who are apart of the NSLP as of October 2019.

Families receiving P-EBT will get a payment of $5.70 per student per day of school closure through this new initiative, bringing more than $200 million in federal funding to the state.

The Department of Transitional Assistance and the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education is working with school districts to provide P-EBT benefits to families in need.

“I’m happy to be working across agencies to get these additional benefits to eligible students’ families,” Elementary and Secondary Education Commissioner Jeffrey C. Riley said. “This will supplement the great work that districts and other organizations are already doing to provide grab-and-go meals to students, and I know that many families’ needs have increased as a result of the pandemic.”

Funds through the program will be issued in the coming weeks, beginning with households with active Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program cases. Nearly half of the households who will receive assistance are reportedly SNAP recipients.

The Baker-Polito administration is partnering with Project Bread and the Shah Family Foundation to share information and resources with households who will be receiving P-EBT.

“We know we need big solutions to solve a crisis of this size,” said Erin McAleer, President of Project Bread. “P-EBT is a great example and we applaud our leaders here in Massachusetts and DTA for taking action so more than 500,000 kids can buy food that will help keep them healthy during the crisis.”

More information about P-EBT can be found here.

The Shah Foundation will be setting up a P-EBT page with additional information. For questions about P-EBT or other food access resources, call Project Bread’s FoodSource hotline at (800) 645-8333.

764,764,https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/264789707/award-winning-actress-shirley-knight-dies-at-83,Award-Winning Actress Shirley Knight Dies at 83,LOS ANGELES - Shirley Knight the Kansas-born actress who was nominated for two Oscars early in her career and went on to play,www.bignewsnetwork.com,"LOS ANGELES - Shirley Knight, the Kansas-born actress who was nominated for two Oscars early in her career and went on to play an astonishing variety of roles in movies, TV and the stage, has died. She was 83.

Knight passed away Wednesday at her daughter's home in San Marcos, Texas, according to her daughter Kaitlin Hopkins.

Knight's career carried her from Kansas to Hollywood and then to the New York theater and London and back to Hollywood. She was nominated for two Tonys, winning one. In recent years, she had a recurring role as Phyllis Van de Kamp (the mother-in-law of Marcia Cross' character) in the long-running ABC show ""Desperate Housewives,"" gaining one of her many Emmy nominations.

Knight's her first Academy Award nomination for best supporting actress came in just her second screen role, as an Oklahoman in love with a Jewish man in the 1960 film version of William Inges' play ""The Dark at the Top of the Stairs.""

She was nominated for best supporting actress two years later for her role as the woman seduced and abandoned by Paul Newman in the 1962 film ""Sweet Bird of Youth,"" based on the Tennessee Williams play.

As success beckoned in 1960, she told columnist Hedda Hopper that she was struggling to keep on an even keel and keep bettering herself as an actress.

""So many actors, once they became famous, lose some beautiful inner thing, something they should try hard to keep,"" she said. ""They begin to think too highly of themselves and success.""

For a time, she lived in New York, where she studied with Lee Strasberg. She turned down an offer to play Ophelia to Richard Burton's Hamlet, preferring to appear on Broadway in 1964 with Geraldine Page and Kim Stanley in Anton Chekhov's ""The Three Sisters,"" a play directed by Strasberg.

Her beauty helped bring her roles in such films as ""The Group"" (1966), based on Mary McCarthy's novel about the lives of a group of college girls, and ""Dutchman"" (1967), from Amiri Baraka's explosive one-act play about a middle-class black man and a sexually provocative white woman. After playing a pregnant woman who runs off with a football player in Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Rain People,"" released in 1969, she wearied of the Hollywood routine, terming the studio bosses ""blockheads.""

Knight moved to England with her second husband, British playwright John Hopkins, with whom she had a daughter, Sophie. (Her first husband was producer Gene Persson, father of her older daughter, Kaitlin).

Over the next few years, she raised her daughters and did needlework. But ""I decided that acting is what I do best,"" she said. The family moved back to the U.S. and she returned to films in ""Beyond the Poseidon Adventure."" She also appeared in such films as ""Endless Love"" (as Brooke Shields' mother), ""As Good as It Gets"" (as Helen Hunt's mother) and ""Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood.""

Meanwhile, she thrived on stage and television. She won a Tony award in 1976 as best featured actress in a play for ""Kennedy's Children."" Knight played, in the words of The New York Times review, ""a very tart tart with an ambition of gold.""

She was nominated for another Tony in 1997 for best actress in Horton Foote's ""The Young Man From Atlanta."" As the Times put it, ""the splendid Ms. Knight, who doesn't waste a single fluttery gesture, brings an Ibsenesque weight to a woman frozen in the role of petulant, spoiled child bride.""

Knight became active in television starting in the '80s and was nominated for Emmys eight times from 1981 to 2006. She won a guest actress Emmy in 1988 for playing Mel Harris' mother in ""Thirtysomething,"" and then won two Emmys in the same year, 1995: one for a supporting actress role in the TV drama ""Indictment: The McMartin Trial,"" and a second for a guest actress role as a murder victim in ""NYPD Blue.""

She was born Shirley Enola Knight on July 5, 1936, in the Kansas countryside, 10 miles from the town of Lyons. Her family was musical and she learned to sing, tap dance and play instruments.

She was the first in her family to enter college, winning a scholarship to a church college in Enid, Oklahoma, then moved to Wichita State University. She appeared in 32 plays in two years and did two seasons of summer stock.

She aimed to become an opera singer, then switched to acting when she saw Julie Harris in a touring company of ""The Lark."" She traveled west to study acting at the Pasadena Playhouse. Warner Bros. signed her to a contract."

The move comes as Britain prepares to restart contact tracing for the virus, which it abandoned during the early weeks of the epidemic.

Health secretary Matt Hancock, who has set a goal of 100,000 tests a day by the end of April, told a press conference in Downing Street that daily testing capacity had reached 50,000.

“Because capacity has now increased so substantially we are now able to expand who can get the tests. Our ultimate goal is that everyone who could benefit from a test gets a test,” he said.

The British government estimates that about 10 million people could be eligible for the tests, which companies will also be able to book on behalf of their employees.

Some of Britain’s drive-through testing centres have been underused, but John Newton, who is leading the testing strategy, said more mobile units would help the system to reach the target of 100,000 tests a day. “We’re going to have 48 of these pop-up facilities which can travel around the country to where they’re needed most–for example, in care homes.”

Mr Hancock also announced plans to recruit 18,000 people to trace coronavirus infections, promising to roll out contact tracing infrastructure on a large scale.

“Test, track and trace, done effectively, can help to suppress the transmission in a way that allows you then to have lesser rules,” he said.

“Critically, test, track and trace works more effectively when the rate of new cases is lower. So the lower the rate of new cases, the more effectively you can keep it down using test, track and trace rather than having to use heavier social-distancing measures.”

A total of 18,738 people have died from coronavirus in hospitals in Britain, an increase of 638 reported deaths since Wednesday. Chief scientific adviser Patrick Vallance said that although the number of infections, hospitalisations and deaths was falling or flattening, there were regional variations across the country.

“I think London is ahead of the rest of the country maybe by a couple of weeks, but there is quite a lot of synchrony right across the country, it’s not massively different. I can’t be absolutely sure about this, but I think two or three weeks is the sort of order where you might expect to see some differences across the country.”

Sir Patrick said the government’s scientific advisers were evaluating whether people should wear face masks in public, but that the evidence about their usefulness was “quite variable, quite weak and difficult to know”."

""In many places you hear about one of the effects of this...",www.ncronline.org,"Pope Francis gives the homily during his early morning Mass April 23, 2020, in the chapel of the Domus Sanctae Marthae at the Vatican. In his homily, Pope Francis said people need to trust that Jesus prays for them and intercedes for them before God the father. (CNS/Vatican Media)

Vatican City — Pope Francis prayed for families struggling economically during the COVID-19 pandemic and for the conversion of loan sharks who prey on them.

""In many places you hear about one of the effects of this pandemic: many families who are in need, who are hungry and, unfortunately, a group of loan sharks 'helps' them. This is another pandemic,"" the pope said April 23 at the beginning of his early morning Mass.

The pope described as a ""social pandemic"" the fact that many day laborers or people paid under the table have not been able to work during the lockdown, so ""they have nothing for them or their children to eat.""

""And moneylenders take what little they have,"" he said. ""Let us pray. Let's pray for these families and their many children"" and also ""for the moneylenders that the Lord would touch their hearts and convert them.""

In his homily at the Mass, which was livestreamed from the chapel of his residence, Francis focused on the transformation of St. Peter from a ""coward"" who denied Jesus to a bold preacher who stood up to the Sanhedrin.

""What was the secret, what was the strength that got Peter to that point?"" the pope asked.

The answer, he said, is found in what Jesus had told Peter at the Last Supper: ""I have prayed that your own faith may not fail; and once you have turned back, you must strengthen your brothers.""

""This is Peter's secret: the prayer of Jesus. Jesus prays for Peter,"" the pope said. ""And what Jesus does for Peter, he does for all of us. Jesus prays for us; he prays for us before the Father.""

Francis told his listeners that it is helpful to contemplate the idea of the risen Jesus appearing before God and showing God the wounds in his hands and feet — ""the price of our salvation.""

""We are used to praying to Jesus that he would give us this or that grace, that he would help us,"" the pope said, ""but we are not used to contemplating Jesus who shows the Father his wounds, Jesus the intercessor, Jesus who prays for us.""

""Peter was able to make the journey from being a coward to being brave with the gift of the Holy Spirit thanks to the prayer of Jesus,"" he said.

""We should think about this. Let's turn to Jesus, thanking him for praying for us. Jesus prays for each one of us,"" he said. ""We need to trust more, more in the prayer of Jesus than in our prayers."""

All these adjustments show us the power of being intentional and flexible when it comes to our household finances.

One of the top 10 things South Africans ask Google about money is “where does my money go?”. I would like to add to that question: “what value does my spending create?”.

The value has nothing to do with the feeling you get when you buy something, it has to do with the long-term impact it will have on your time, energy and resources.

If you consider things you buy on credit, it impacts your time because you have to devote more working hours to pay it off, more resources (money) are directed to the high-interest rates charged on the accounts and your energy levels decrease because of the amount of stress debt brings to your life.

As most of their time, resources and energy are devoted to debt, many people who can’t manage their debt feel like they’ve lost control over their lives.

If you are struggling with debt management speak to your credit providers about the payment plans that are available and which is best for you. Overcoming your debt gives you room to build an emergency fund and investments.

Budgeting has never been more important than it is right now. With the uncertainty of job security due to the negative impact of the lockdown on businesses, you need to manage your household finances and set appropriate expectations.

The first step in putting together a budget is to look at how each pocket of your finances is currently financed. The different pockets are household, savings, transport and entertainment.

As you put together the pockets, you should mark which are covered by credit and which by your income.

The next step is to assess where you can cut costs and where you can be more flexible.

A very important part of a successful budget is to set realistic expectations for yourself and your family.

An honest conversation with your dependants on what you can commit to and where you may need assistance, creates a firm foundation for financial planning.

Being consistent in what you’ve said is important for everyone, including yourself to take it seriously. When you are not consistent, people will mirror that behaviour to you as well.

With an adjustment in your finances comes an adjustment in your lifestyle, where you may now have to choose between a lifestyle expense and a need. It’s important that you let your status or ego take a back seat as you choose to invest in your life to create long-term value.

In the past week, quite a few clients have asked about stopping their investment debit orders, cancelling insurance and reducing their medical scheme packages.

When you are cutting costs in your budget, it is important to ask for professional advice before making any rash decisions.

Let’s say lockdown has forced Pearl to free up cash and she chooses not to pay her insurance premiums. Whereas she could have spoken to her insurance company about a premium holiday, which allows her to not pay her premiums for a specified period and still be covered, Pearl’s decision has now left her with no cover and possible higher premiums should she open a new contract when she is by the means.

We are currently living in unusual circumstances with great uncertainty, but we do have control over how we respond. As you assess your finances, be intentional, committed and seek guidance for a successful budget.

Speaking at his daily White House briefing, the president said: ""I think it's too soon. But at the same time, he must do what he thinks is right.""",www.independent.co.uk,"Donald Trump has said he disagrees with the controversial decision by Georgia governor Brian Kemp to start relaxing social distancing measures this week, but added that his fellow Republican had to do what he thinks is right.

Speaking at his daily White House briefing, the president said: ""I think it's too soon. But at the same time, he must do what he thinks is right.""

He added: ""Would I do that? No, I'd wait a little longer."" However, he called Mr Kemp ""a capable man who knows what he's doing"".

On Monday Mr Kemp announced that he would allow businesses including bowling alleys, tattoo parlours, nail salons, massage therapists and gyms to open on Friday. He said that church services could resume with social distancing measures, and said that restaurants and cinemas would be able to reopen from Monday.

The president's intervention is surprising as Mr Trump has not only been urging states to open back up for business as soon as possible, but has even been encouraging demonstrators across the country – some of them armed – who have been protesting against stay-at-home and social distancing orders.

He has also repeatedly praised Republican governors who have been accused of dragging their feet over the pandemic – such as Mr Kemp and Florida's Ron DeSantis – while criticising and insulting Democratic governors who have taken actions to limit the spread of the deadly virus, which has infected more than 800,000 Americans and killed more than 41,000.

Georgia has had more than 19,000 cases and more than 800 deaths.

Later in the same briefing Anthony Fauci, one of the lead medical experts on the White House coronavirus taskforce, said: ""If I were advising the governor, I would tell him he should be careful.

""Going ahead and leapfrogging into phases where you should not be ... I would advise him not to do that.""

Earlier on Wednesday computer projections from the University of Washington‘s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation suggested that states should not begin to scale back stay-at-home and social distancing measures for weeks or even months.

It suggested that Georgia should not be reopening until 8 June."

Renowned French Dr. Didier Raoult DESTROYS Liberal Trump-Hating Media on VA Junk Report on Hydroxychloroquine (VIDEO),,freerepublic.com,"Ever since President Trump mentioned the highly successful studies of hydroxychloroquine treatments on coronavirus patients the media has downplayed and miracle drug.

The far left Washington Post led the charge early.

Dr. Fauci cheered the use of hydroxychloroquine in treating the MERS virus in 2013  but played down the drugs effectiveness this month.

There have now been several studies touting the use of hydroxychloroquine and antibiotics in treating coronavirus.

Each test found amazing results using the drug.

n late March FOX News host Laura Ingraham reported on the latest study by the French research team led by the renowned epidemiologist Dr. Didier Raoult was able to repeat his findings from a previous study.

This time Dr. Raoult administered hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin to 80 patients and observed improvement in EVERY CASE except for a very sick 86-year-old with an advanced form of coronavirus infection.



The vaccine industry is a juggernaut and has all the government officials on its side There is a 10 billion Dollar fund to pay off people whose children have been killed of her lives have been ruined through autism through over vaccination at a young age SIDS the sudden infant death syndrome did not exist before mass vaccination began in the 1970s Does anybody remember the giant measles scare last year around New York and California forest every human being to get a vaccine supposedly although me and my family opted out and found a doctor to get us out of it? They are do-gooders from hell 



The last thing the Treasonists want is for this virus to have any kind of cure or end. I predicted two weeks ago that the second this virus showed the slightest bit of slowing down, the Treasonists would announce that it would come back even worse and yesterday ....Oh my!.. 



Maybe I am a bit of a contrarian (OK, I am), and getting really cranky over here in Washington (definitely). This article is example of why I have issues with Gateway Pundit. Sometimes, they are good, other times, they are examples of how not to practice journalism. First, the claim Dr Fauci supported hydroxychlorquine in a MERS study is a lie. I already heard that story and looked it up. The study was by Dr. Darryl Falzarano, Treatment with interferon-Î±2b and ribavirin improves outcome in MERS-CoV-infected rhesus macaques. Interferon-Î±2b and ribavirin are not alternate names for hydroxychlorqine. The study was a proper clinical trial, which is the standard Fauci and others in clinical research use. This is being twisted by retelling it to making the claim that Dr. Fauci supported hydroxychlorquine for SARs, when he did not. His support was for interferon-Î±2b and ribavirin in a proper clinical trial. Gateway Pundit did not bother to find the original study. Here they linked to one of their own articles, making that claim, linking to a tweet, about a article in USA Today. about this clinical trial. Because getting to original sources and representing them accurately is something Hoft rarely does well when he wants ALL CAPS! in the title. Second, Hoft dicusses doctor Rault down at the bottom of the page. What he said, what other have said about what he said, posts a video, a picture from earlier this month, and never provides a source to Dr. Rault's actual response, Response to Magagnoli, MedRxiv, 2020. As expected, Dr. Rault is extremely good at standing up for himself against his critics.

The fund was directly deposited into each state’s COVID-19 Committees’ accounts. The donation is seen by many as a challenge to other diaspora groups.

The financial intervention followed OPU members’ resolution at the end of Ekiti World Congress in January. It was resolved that there should be regular support from Yoruba sons and daughters in foreign countries whenever the need arises.

According to the Global Convener of the Union, The Aare Onakakanfo of Yorubaland, Iba Gani Adams, the donation is to be given to those that are directly affected by the pandemic – for their drugs, treatment and food. The donation was from the contribution of individual members all over the world.

OPU is a non-governmental, non religious organization established to foster unity among the Yoruba race and provide a formidable platform for all Yoruba sons and daughters in the diaspora for the purpose of working for the common interest of the people.

‘’It is very important that all of us, as an international group, help the less privileged and remember millions of our people that are staying at home at this moment because of Corona Virus, and most especially those that are sick due to the virus’’, Gani Adams added.

The Chairman of OPU’s Covid-19 Fund Raising Committee, Comrade Larry Aderoju, stated that helping the victims at this critical time is important as history would not forget those that have deemed it fit to help in whatever little way they could.

He added that the financial intervention had become urgent having taken into consideration the gradual spread, and the increase in the numbers of people that have contacted the disease in Nigeria and the South West States in particular.

While explaining further on the future intervention of OPU when the need arises, the organisation’s Worldwide Publicity Secretary, Comrade Zacheaus Somorin, stated that, having spread across the world in terms of quality membership, it is expected that Yoruba sons and daughters in diaspora would always rise to the occasion."

The International Union of Operating Engineers (IUOE), which represents more than 400,000 mechanics and machine operators nationwide, said it supports the effort to do away with surprise billing, but that the bipartisan legislation gaining traction in Congress would “impose devastating cuts to frontline medical providers and tilt the playing field in favor of insurers.”

“The proposals would give insurance companies outsized power to set artificially low reimbursement rates, reducing revenue that physicians and clinicians across the country depend on to keep the doors open,” union President James Callahan wrote to the Democratic leaders. “This policy would likely lead to physician shortages and even facility closures in many vulnerable rural and underserved communities, just as these critical providers are desperately needed.”

A bipartisan deal reached last year by the leaders of the House Energy and Commerce and the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pension (HELP) committees would ban providers from sending the surprise bills, and would instead require insurers to foot the payments, with the costs benchmarked to the average price of the service.

A House committee aide disputed the union’s characterization, describing the bill as a middle ground between arbitration and price benchmarking. If the surprise bill is for more than $750, either party can bring it to arbitration, the aide said, but otherwise the provider will get paid the median in-network rate for that geographic region.

The aide noted that the legislation does not block states from having their own laws to address surprise billing claims.

Conservative groups have been raising alarms about the HELP legislation for months, saying it would implement “price controls” or “rate-setting” that gives the government too much domain over the private sector and would pave the way for a single-payer system.

Supporters of the legislation bristle at this allegation, arguing that the federal government will not be setting the price. The committee aide also said the legislation would not result in cuts to frontline medical providers, as Callahan claimed, but rather would level the playing field between insurers and patients.

Insurers support the legislation, which is backed by Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Frank Pallone Jr. (D-N.J.), Rep.

Alexander and Walden are retiring at the end of the year, adding to the pressure they’re under to get the legislation passed.

Lawmakers tried to get the bill included in the 2019 end-of-year spending package, and then again into one of the coronavirus stimulus bills, without success.

The IUOE said it would support creating independent boards to mediate billing disputes, pointing to a model used in New York, that the union said has saved consumers $400 million dollars and reduced out-of-network billing by 34 percent since being implemented in 2015.

In the letter, the union bashed the insurers for supporting the HELP bill.

“This month, one major insurance company, United Health, beat its quarterly profit expectations as its stock price soared and its corporate executives continued to thrive,” Callahan wrote. “Meanwhile, hospitals and medical practices have been forced to cut hours, furlough healthcare workers, and, in some cases, close due to financial strain. There are better solutions to fix surprise billing that do not put the nation’s healthcare safety net or patients’ access to care at risk.”"

""Allocating funds from the Coronavirus Relief Fund to the Alaska Native Corporations will severely impact the Navajo Nation's ability to fight COVID-19, and will impact every other tribe as well,"" President Jonathan said in a statement. ""While the Secretary has not yet announced a formula to disburse the funds, including the Alaska Native Corporations in the calculation will reduce the funds available for tribal governments. The impact on the Navajo Nation will be significant because of the Nation's size, population, and the already disparate impact of COVID-19 on the Nation.""

Native tribes from across the country filed a lawsuit last week. Since then, other tribes have joined the lawsuit's efforts.

The concerns, according to the Navajo Nation's news release, are that Alaska Native Corporations are ""owned by shareholders, including non-Indian shareholders,"" and could access other funds within the CARES Act, the $2.2 trillion government stimulus package that was passed by Congress due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

""Funds need to be prioritized for federally-recognized tribes, not corporations,"" President Nez said.

In an opinion piece published in the Anchorage Daily News on Wednesday, Alaska Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan reportedly defended the inclusion of Alaska Native Corporations and called the accusations again the Alaska Native Corporations characterized and unfair.

""This week, we heard concerns that relief funds will be used as a so-called corporate bailout for ANCs. This is a blatant misrepresentation of, the CARES Act, which specifically limits payments to: necessary expenditures incurred due to the public health emergency, costs that were not accounted for in their recent budget, and costs incurred from March 1 to December 30, 2020, the senators wrote.

""The relief fund is not meant to offset ANCs’ corporate losses, just as it is not meant to offset gaming losses that may be incurred by Lower 48 tribally owned casinos. To the extent ANCs make expenditures to respond to the public health emergency, it is only fair they be able to access relief funds.""

According to a recent Associated Press report, the United States Department of the Interior said the Alaska Native Corporations were eligible for funding.

As of Tuesday evening, the Navajo Nation, which spans northeastern Arizona, and portions of Utah and New Mexico, reported a total of 1,206 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 48 deaths. In Arizona, the Arizona Department of Health Services reports 5,459 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 229 deaths."

He was the first player to commit in that cycle, giving his pledge all the way back in August 2017.

His first season in Chapel Hill didn’t go exactly as planned. North Carolina obviously disappointed, going 14-19 and getting knocked out in the ACC Tournament, before the remainder of that event was canceled. Personally, he was limited by injury during the year as well.

Francis played in 16 total games, averaging 3.3 points and 1.6 assists in 13.6 minutes per game.

He is now entering the transfer portal ahead of the 2020-21 season. The Ohio native had other strong offers out of high school, including Dayton, Florida State, Indiana, Iowa, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio State, Purdue, TCU, Virginia Tech, and West Virginia. We’ll see which schools get involved now.

Francis was a three-star composite recruit coming out of Pickerington Central High School. 247 ranked him No. 179 overall in the class.

He was the No. 19 point guard and No. 4 recruit out of the state of Ohio in the 2019 class.

He is not the only departing guard for North Carolina. Earlier this week, Cole Anthony, a candidate for the first overall pick in the 2020 NBA Draft, officially declared, and is leaving the Tar Heels.

The 2020 class will bring some serious backcourt talent, though. Five-star point guard Caleb Love and four-star combo guard R.J. Davis are two of five blue-chip players joining Roy Williams’ program. The class is currently ranked No. 3 in the country."

But love conquers all — even stay-at-home and social-distancing orders in the age of the coronavirus.

So Mayor Steve Noble has stepped up to preside over nuptials remotely.

""As long as the couple is together, holding hands and ready to spend their life together, that’s really the part that matters the most,” Noble said in an email Thursday. “It has been a pleasure to be welcomed into these special ceremonies, and I feel as though, during this pandemic, being able to have a virtual window into the love that two people have for each other always warms the heart.”

Noble, who has performed some 200 marriages at City Hall since becoming mayor in January 2016, said presiding over weddings via the internet is the logical alternative as City Hall remains closed to the public due to the virus outbreak.

Noble said he has not performed any virtual ceremonies yet but expects to do so in the coming weeks from his City Hall office.

Noble said New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo gave mayors in the state permission to conduct wedding ceremonies online.

“I am happy that the governor has made this possible,” he said. “We want to make sure life goes on in our community, and allowing people to get married would be a bright spot in a difficult time.”

Information about how to obtain a marriage license from the City Clerk's Office while City Hall is closed is available online at bit.ly/2Vx84fO or by phone at (845) 334-3914.

Once the licensing process is complete, if a couple wants to have Noble officiate remotely, they should contact his office at (845) 334-3902 or mayor@kingston-ny.gov.
